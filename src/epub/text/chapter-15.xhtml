			<p><i>(The Mabbot street entrance of nighttown, before which stretches an uncobbled tramsiding set with skeleton tracks, red and green will-o’-the-wisps and danger signals. Rows of grimy houses with gaping doors. Rare lamps with faint rainbow fans. Round Rabaiotti’s halted ice gondola stunted men and women squabble. They grab wafers between which are wedged lumps of coral and copper snow. Sucking, they scatter slowly. Children. The swancomb of the gondola, highreared, forges on through the murk, white and blue under a lighthouse. Whistles call and answer.)</i></p>
			<p>THE CALLS: Wait, my love, and I’ll be with you.</p>
			<p>THE ANSWERS: Round behind the stable.</p>
			<p><i>(A deafmute idiot with goggle eyes, his shapeless mouth dribbling, jerks past, shaken in Saint Vitus’ dance. A chain of children ’s hands imprisons him.)</i></p>
			<p>THE CHILDREN: Kithogue! Salute!</p>
			<p>THE IDIOT: <i>(Lifts a palsied left arm and gurgles.)</i> Grhahute!</p>
			<p>THE CHILDREN: Where’s the great light?</p>
			<p>THE IDIOT: <i>(Gobbling.)</i> Ghaghahest.</p>
			<p><i>(They release him. He jerks on. A pigmy woman swings on a rope slung between two railings, counting. A form sprawled against a dustbin and muffled by its arm and hat snores, groans, grinding growling teeth, and snores again. On a step a gnome totting among a rubbishtip crouches to shoulder a sack of rags and bones. A crone standing by with a smoky oillamp rams her last bottle in the maw of his sack. He heaves his booty, tugs askew his peaked cap and hobbles off mutely. The crone makes back for her lair, swaying her lamp. A bandy child, asquat on the doorstep with a paper shuttlecock, crawls sidling after her in spurts, clutches her skirt, scrambles up. A drunken navvy grips with both hands the railings of an area, lurching heavily. At a corner two night watch in shouldercapes, their hands upon their staffholsters, loom tall. A plate crashes: a woman screams: a child wails. Oaths of a man roar, mutter, cease. Figures wander, lurk, peer from warrens. In a room lit by a candle stuck in a bottleneck a slut combs out the tatts from the hair of a scrofulous child. Cissy Caffrey’s voice, still young, sings shrill from a lane.)</i></p>

			</blockquote>
			<p><i>(Private Carr and Private Compton, swaggersticks tight in their oxters, as they march unsteadily rightaboutface and burst together from their mouths a volleyed fart. Laughter of men from the lane. A hoarse virago retorts.)</i></p>
			<p>THE VIRAGO: Signs on you, hairy arse. More power the Cavan girl.</p>

			<p><i>(Stephen, flourishing the ashplant in his left hand, chants with joy the</i> introit <i>for paschal time. Lynch, his jockeycap low on his brow, attends him, a sneer of discontent wrinkling his face.)</i></p>
			<p>STEPHEN: <i>Vidi aquam egredientem de templo a latere dextro. Alleluia</i>.</p>
			<p><i>(The famished snaggletusks of an elderly bawd protrude from a doorway.)</i></p>
			<p>THE BAWD: <i>(Her voice whispering huskily.)</i> Sst! Come here till I tell you. Maidenhead inside. Sst!</p>
			<p>STEPHEN: <i>(Altius aliquantulum.) Et omnes ad quos pervenit aqua ista</i>.</p>
			<p>THE BAWD: <i>(Spits in their trail her jet of venom.)</i> Trinity medicals. Fallopian tube. All prick and no pence.</p>
			<p><i>(Edy Boardman, sniffling, crouched with Bertha Supple, draws her shawl across her nostrils.)</i></p>
			<p>EDY BOARDMAN: <i>(Bickering.)</i> And says the one: I seen you up Faithful place with your squarepusher, the greaser off the railway, in his cometobed hat. Did you, says I. That’s not for you to say, says I. You never seen me in the mantrap with a married highlander, says I. The likes of her! Stag that one is! Stubborn as a mule! And her walking with two fellows the one time, Kilbride, the enginedriver, and lancecorporal Oliphant.</p>
			<p>STEPHEN: <i>(Triumphaliter.) Salvi facti sunt.</i></p>
			<p><i>(He flourishes his ashplant, shivering the lamp image, shattering light over the world. A liver and white spaniel on the prowl slinks after him, growling. Lynch scares it with a kick.)</i></p>
			<p>LYNCH: So that?</p>
			<p>STEPHEN: (<i>Looks behind</i>.) So that gesture, not music not odour, would be a universal language, the gift of tongues rendering visible not the lay sense but the first entelechy, the structural rhythm.</p>
			<p>LYNCH: Pornosophical philotheology. Metaphysics in Mecklenburgh street!</p>
			<p>STEPHEN: We have shrewridden Shakespeare and henpecked Socrates. Even the allwisest Stagyrite was bitted, bridled and mounted by a light of love.</p>
			<p>LYNCH: Ba!</p>
			<p>STEPHEN: Anyway, who wants two gestures to illustrate a loaf and a jug? This movement illustrates the loaf and jug of bread or wine in Omar. Hold my stick.</p>
			<p>LYNCH: Damn your yellow stick. Where are we going?</p>
			<p>STEPHEN: Lecherous lynx, to <i>la belle dame sans merci,</i> Georgina Johnson, <i>ad deam qui laetificat iuventutem meam.</i></p>
			<p><i>(Stephen thrusts the ashplant on him and slowly holds out his hands, his head going back till both hands are a span from his breast, down turned, in planes intersecting, the fingers about to part, the left being higher.)</i></p>
			<p>LYNCH: Which is the jug of bread? It skills not. That or the customhouse. Illustrate thou. Here take your crutch and walk.</p>
			<p><i>(They pass. Tommy Caffrey scrambles to a gaslamp and, clasping, climbs in spasms. From the top spur he slides down. Jacky Caffrey clasps to climb. The navvy lurches against the lamp. The twins scuttle off in the dark. The navvy, swaying, presses a forefinger against a wing of his nose and ejects from the farther nostril a long liquid jet of snot. Shouldering the lamp he staggers away through the crowd with his flaring cresset.</i></p>
			<p><i>Snakes of river fog creep slowly. From drains, clefts, cesspools, middens arise on all sides stagnant fumes. A glow leaps in the south beyond the seaward reaches of the river. The navvy, staggering forward, cleaves the crowd and lurches towards the tramsiding. On the farther side under the railway bridge Bloom appears, flushed, panting, cramming bread and chocolate into a sidepocket. From Gillen’s hairdresser’s window a composite portrait shows him gallant Nelson’s image. A concave mirror at the side presents to him lovelorn longlost lugubru Booloohoom. Grave Gladstone sees him level, Bloom for Bloom. He passes, struck by the stare of truculent Wellington, but in the convex mirror grin unstruck the bonham eyes and fatchuck cheekchops of Jollypoldy the rixdix doldy.</i></p>
			<p><i>At Antonio Rabaiotti’s door Bloom halts, sweated under the bright arclamp. He disappears. In a moment he reappears and hurries on.)</i></p>
			<p>BLOOM: Fish and taters. N. g. Ah!</p>
			<p><i>(He disappears into Olhausen’s, the porkbutcher’s, under the downcoming rollshutter. A few moments later he emerges from under the shutter, puffing Poldy, blowing Bloohoom. In each hand he holds a parcel, one containing a lukewarm pig’s crubeen, the other a cold sheep’s trotter, sprinkled with wholepepper. He gasps, standing upright. Then bending to one side he presses a parcel against his ribs and groans.)</i></p>
			<p>BLOOM: Stitch in my side. Why did I run?</p>
			<p><i>(He takes breath with care and goes forward slowly towards the lampset siding. The glow leaps again.)</i></p>
			<p>BLOOM: What is that? A flasher? Searchlight.</p>
			<p><i>(He stands at Cormack’s corner, watching.)</i></p>
			<p>BLOOM: <i>Aurora borealis</i> or a steel foundry? Ah, the brigade, of course. South side anyhow. Big blaze. Might be his house. Beggar’s bush. We’re safe. <i>(He hums cheerfully.)</i> London’s burning, London’s burning! On fire, on fire! (<i>He catches sight of the navvy lurching through the crowd at the farther side of Talbot street.</i>) I’ll miss him. Run. Quick. Better cross here.</p>
			<p><i>(He darts to cross the road. Urchins shout.)</i></p>
			<p>THE URCHINS: Mind out, mister!</p>
			<p>(<i>Two cyclists, with lighted paper lanterns aswing, swim by him, grazing him, their bells rattling.</i>)</p>
			<p>THE BELLS: Haltyaltyaltyall.</p>
			<p>BLOOM: <i>(Halts erect, stung by a spasm.)</i> Ow!</p>
			<p><i>(He looks round, darts forward suddenly. Through rising fog a dragon sandstrewer, travelling at caution, slews heavily down upon him, its huge red headlight winking, its trolley hissing on the wire. The motorman bangs his footgong.)</i></p>
			<p>THE GONG: Bang Bang Bla Bak Blud Bugg Bloo.</p>
			<p><i>(The brake cracks violently. Bloom, raising a policeman’s whitegloved hand, blunders stifflegged out of the track. The motorman, thrown forward, pugnosed, on the guidewheel, yells as he slides past over chains and keys.)</i></p>
			<p>THE MOTORMAN: Hey, shitbreeches, are you doing the hat trick?</p>
			<p><i>(Bloom trickleaps to the curbstone and halts again. He brushes a mudflake from his cheek with a parcelled hand.)</i></p>
			<p>BLOOM: No thoroughfare. Close shave that but cured the stitch. Must take up Sandow’s exercises again. On the hands down. Insure against street accident too. The Providential. <i>(He feels his trouser pocket.)</i> Poor mamma’s panacea. Heel easily catch in track or bootlace in a cog. Day the wheel of the black Maria peeled off my shoe at Leonard’s corner. Third time is the charm. Shoe trick. Insolent driver. I ought to report him. Tension makes them nervous. Might be the fellow balked me this morning with that horsey woman. Same style of beauty. Quick of him all the same. The stiff walk. True word spoken in jest. That awful cramp in Lad lane. Something poisonous I ate. Emblem of luck. Why? Probably lost cattle. Mark of the beast. <i>(He closes his eyes an instant.)</i> Bit light in the head. Monthly or effect of the other. Brainfogfag. That tired feeling. Too much for me now. Ow!</p>
			<p><i>(A sinister figure leans on plaited legs against O’Beirne’s wall, a visage unknown, injected with dark mercury. From under a wideleaved sombrero the figure regards him with evil eye.)</i></p>
			<p>BLOOM: <i>Buenas noches, señorita Blanca, que calle es esta?</i></p>
			<p>THE FIGURE: (<i>Impassive, raises a signal arm.</i>) Password. <i>Sraid Mabbot.</i></p>
			<p>BLOOM: Haha. <i>Merci.</i> Esperanto. <i>Slan leath. (He mutters.)</i> Gaelic league spy, sent by that fireeater.</p>
			<p><i>(He steps forward. A sackshouldered ragman bars his path. He steps left, ragsackman left.)</i></p>
			<p>BLOOM: I beg.</p>
			<p>(<i>He leaps right, sackragman right.</i>)</p>
			<p>BLOOM: I beg.</p>
			<p>(<i>He swerves, sidles, stepaside, slips past and on.</i>)</p>
			<p>BLOOM: Keep to the right, right, right. If there is a signpost planted by the Touring Club at Stepaside who procured that public boon? I who lost my way and contributed to the columns of the <i>Irish Cyclist</i> the letter headed <i>In darkest Stepaside</i>. Keep, keep, keep to the right. Rags and bones at midnight. A fence more likely. First place murderer makes for. Wash off his sins of the world.</p>
			<p><i>(Jacky Caffrey, hunted by Tommy Caffrey, runs full tilt against Bloom.)</i></p>
			<p>BLOOM: O.</p>
			<p><i>(Shocked, on weak hams, he halts. Tommy and Jacky vanish there, there. Bloom pats with parcelled hands watch, fobpocket, bookpocket, pursepoke, sweets of sin, potato soap.)</i></p>
			<p>BLOOM: Beware of pickpockets. Old thieves’ dodge. Collide. Then snatch your purse.</p>
			<p><i>(The retriever approaches sniffing, nose to the ground. A sprawled form sneezes. A stooped bearded figure appears garbed in the long caftan of an elder in Zion and a smokingcap with magenta tassels. Horned spectacles hang down at the wings of the nose. Yellow poison streaks are on the drawn face.)</i></p>
			<p>RUDOLPH: Second halfcrown waste money today. I told you not go with drunken goy ever. So you catch no money.</p>
			<p>BLOOM: <i>(Hides the crubeen and trotter behind his back and, crestfallen, feels warm and cold feetmeat.) Ja, ich weiss, papachi.</i></p>
			<p>RUDOLPH: What you making down this place? Have you no soul? <i>(With feeble vulture talons he feels the silent face of Bloom.)</i> Are you not my son Leopold, the grandson of Leopold? Are you not my dear son Leopold who left the house of his father and left the god of his fathers Abraham and Jacob?</p>
			<p>BLOOM: <i>(With precaution.)</i> I suppose so, father. Mosenthal. All that’s left of him.</p>
			<p>RUDOLPH: <i>(Severely.)</i> One night they bring you home drunk as dog after spend your good money. What you call them running chaps?</p>
			<p>BLOOM: <i>(In youth’s smart blue Oxford suit with white vestslips, narrowshouldered, in brown Alpine hat, wearing gent’s sterling silver waterbury keyless watch and double curb Albert with seal attached, one side of him coated with stiffening mud.)</i> Harriers, father. Only that once.</p>
			<p>RUDOLPH: Once! Mud head to foot. Cut your hand open. Lockjaw. They make you kaputt, Leopoldleben. You watch them chaps.</p>
			<p>BLOOM: <i>(Weakly.)</i> They challenged me to a sprint. It was muddy. I slipped.</p>
			<p>RUDOLPH: <i>(With contempt.) Goim nachez!</i> Nice spectacles for your poor mother!</p>
			<p>BLOOM: Mamma!</p>
			<p>ELLEN BLOOM: <i>(In pantomime dame’s stringed mobcap, widow Twankey’s crinoline and bustle, blouse with muttonleg sleeves buttoned behind, grey mittens and cameo brooch, her plaited hair in a crispine net, appears over the staircase banisters, a slanted candlestick in her hand, and cries out in shrill alarm.)</i> O blessed Redeemer, what have they done to him! My smelling salts! <i>(She hauls up a reef of skirt and ransacks the pouch of her striped blay petticoat. A phial, an Agnus Dei, a shrivelled potato and a celluloid doll fall out.)</i> Sacred Heart of Mary, where were you at all at all?</p>
			<p><i>(Bloom, mumbling, his eyes downcast, begins to bestow his parcels in his filled pockets but desists, muttering.)</i></p>
			<p>A VOICE: <i>(Sharply.)</i> Poldy!</p>
			<p>BLOOM: Who? <i>(He ducks and wards off a blow clumsily.)</i> At your service.</p>
			<p><i>(He looks up. Beside her mirage of datepalms a handsome woman in Turkish costume stands before him. Opulent curves fill out her scarlet trousers and jacket, slashed with gold. A wide yellow cummerbund girdles her. A white yashmak, violet in the night, covers her face, leaving free only her large dark eyes and raven hair.)</i></p>
			<p>BLOOM: Molly!</p>
			<p>MARION: Welly? <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs</abbr> Marion from this out, my dear man, when you speak to me. <i>(Satirically.)</i> Has poor little hubby cold feet waiting so long?</p>
			<p>BLOOM: <i>(Shifts from foot to foot.)</i> No, no. Not the least little bit.</p>
			<p><i>(He breathes in deep agitation, swallowing gulps of air, questions, hopes, crubeens for her supper, things to tell her, excuse, desire, spellbound. A coin gleams on her forehead. On her feet are jewelled toerings. Her ankles are linked by a slender fetterchain. Beside her a camel, hooded with a turreting turban, waits. A silk ladder of innumerable rungs climbs to his bobbing howdah. He ambles near with disgruntled hindquarters. Fiercely she slaps his haunch, her goldcurb wristbangles angriling, scolding him in Moorish.)</i></p>
			<p>MARION: Nebrakada! Femininum!</p>
			<p><i>(The camel, lifting a foreleg, plucks from a tree a large mango fruit, offers it to his mistress, blinking, in his cloven hoof, then droops his head and, grunting, with uplifted neck, fumbles to kneel. Bloom stoops his back for leapfrog.)</i></p>
			<p>BLOOM: I can give you... I mean as your business menagerer... <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs</abbr> Marion... if you...</p>
			<p>MARION: So you notice some change? <i>(Her hands passing slowly over her trinketed stomacher, a slow friendly mockery in her eyes.)</i> O Poldy, Poldy, you are a poor old stick in the mud! Go and see life. See the wide world.</p>
			<p>BLOOM: I was just going back for that lotion whitewax, orangeflower water. Shop closes early on Thursday. But the first thing in the morning. <i>(He pats divers pockets.)</i> This moving kidney. Ah!</p>
			<p><i>(He points to the south, then to the east. A cake of new clean lemon soap arises, diffusing light and perfume.)</i></p>
			<p>THE SOAP:</p>
			<blockquote epub:type="z3998:verse">
				<p>
					<span>We’re a capital couple are Bloom and I.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He brightens the earth. I polish the sky.</span>
				</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p><i>(The freckled face of Sweny, the druggist, appears in the disc of the soapsun.)</i></p>
			<p>SWENY: Three and a penny, please.</p>
			<p>BLOOM: Yes. For my wife. <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs</abbr> Marion. Special recipe.</p>
			<p>MARION: <i>(Softly.)</i> Poldy!</p>
			<p>BLOOM: Yes, ma’am?</p>
			<p>MARION: <i>Ti trema un poco il cuore?</i></p>
			<p><i>(In disdain she saunters away, plump as a pampered pouter pigeon, humming the duet from</i> Don Giovanni.)</p>
			<p>BLOOM: Are you sure about that <i>Voglio</i>? I mean the pronunciati...</p>
			<p><i>(He follows, followed by the sniffing terrier. The elderly bawd seizes his sleeve, the bristles of her chinmole glittering.)</i></p>
			<p>THE BAWD: Ten shillings a maidenhead. Fresh thing was never touched. Fifteen. There’s no-one in it only her old father that’s dead drunk.</p>
			<p><i>(She points. In the gap of her dark den furtive, rainbedraggled, Bridie Kelly stands.)</i></p>
			<p>BRIDIE: Hatch street. Any good in your mind?</p>
			<p><i>(With a squeak she flaps her bat shawl and runs. A burly rough pursues with booted strides. He stumbles on the steps, recovers, plunges into gloom. Weak squeaks of laughter are heard, weaker.)</i></p>
			<p>THE BAWD: <i>(Her wolfeyes shining.)</i> He’s getting his pleasure. You won’t get a virgin in the flash houses. Ten shillings. Don’t be all night before the polis in plain clothes sees us. Sixtyseven is a bitch.</p>
			<p><i>(Leering, Gerty Macdowell limps forward. She draws from behind, ogling, and shows coyly her bloodied clout.)</i></p>
			<p>GERTY: With all my worldly goods I thee and thou. <i>(She murmurs.)</i> You did that. I hate you.</p>
			<p>BLOOM: I? When? You’re dreaming. I never saw you.</p>
			<p>THE BAWD: Leave the gentleman alone, you cheat. Writing the gentleman false letters. Streetwalking and soliciting. Better for your mother take the strap to you at the bedpost, hussy like you.</p>
			<p>GERTY: <i>(To Bloom.)</i> When you saw all the secrets of my bottom drawer. <i>(She paws his sleeve, slobbering.)</i> Dirty married man! I love you for doing that to me.</p>
			<p><i>(She glides away crookedly. <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs</abbr> Breen in man’s frieze overcoat with loose bellows pockets, stands in the causeway, her roguish eyes wideopen, smiling in all her herbivorous buckteeth.)</i></p>

			<p>BLOOM: <i>(Hurriedly.)</i> Not so loud my name. Whatever do you think of me? Don’t give me away. Walls have ears. How do you do? It’s ages since I. You’re looking splendid. Absolutely it. Seasonable weather we are having this time of year. Black refracts heat. Short cut home here. Interesting quarter. Rescue of fallen women. Magdalen asylum. I am the secretary...</p>
			<p><abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">MRS</abbr> BREEN: <i>(Holds up a finger.)</i> Now, don’t tell a big fib! I know somebody won’t like that. O just wait till I see Molly! <i>(Slily.)</i> Account for yourself this very sminute or woe betide you!</p>
			<p>BLOOM: <i>(Looks behind.)</i> She often said she’d like to visit. Slumming. The exotic, you see. Negro servants in livery too if she had money. Othello black brute. Eugene Stratton. Even the bones and cornerman at the Livermore christies. Bohee brothers. Sweep for that matter.</p>
			<p><i>(Tom and Sam Bohee, coloured coons in white duck suits, scarlet socks, upstarched Sambo chokers and large scarlet asters in their buttonholes, leap out. Each has his banjo slung. Their paler smaller negroid hands jingle the twingtwang wires. Flashing white Kaffir eyes and tusks they rattle through a breakdown in clumsy clogs, twinging, singing, back to back, toe heel, heel toe, with smackfatclacking nigger lips.)</i></p>

			<p><i>(They whisk black masks from raw babby faces: then, chuckling, chortling, trumming, twanging, they diddle diddle cakewalk dance away.)</i></p>
			<p>BLOOM: <i>(With a sour tenderish smile.)</i> A little frivol, shall we, if you are so inclined? Would you like me perhaps to embrace you just for a fraction of a second?</p>
			<p><abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">MRS</abbr> BREEN: <i>(Screams gaily.)</i> O, you ruck! You ought to see yourself!</p>

Do you remember, harking back in a retrospective arrangement, Old Christmas night, Georgina Simpson’s housewarming while they were playing the Irving Bishop game, finding the pin blindfold and thoughtreading? Subject, what is in this snuffbox?</p>
			<p><abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">MRS</abbr> BREEN: You were the lion of the night with your seriocomic recitation and you looked the part. You were always a favourite with the ladies.</p>
			<p>BLOOM: <i>(Squire of dames, in dinner jacket with wateredsilk facings, blue masonic badge in his buttonhole, black bow and mother-of-pearl studs, a prismatic champagne glass tilted in his hand.)</i> Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Ireland, home and beauty.</p>

Under the mistletoe. Two is company.</p>
			<p>BLOOM: <i>(Wearing a purple Napoleon hat with an amber halfmoon, his fingers and thumb passing slowly down to her soft moist meaty palm which she surrenders gently.)</i> The witching hour of night. I took the splinter out of this hand, carefully, slowly. <i>(Tenderly, as he slips on her finger a ruby ring.) Là ci darem la mano.</i></p>

			<p>BLOOM: <i>(Enthusiastically.)</i> A noble work! I scolded that tramdriver on Harold’s cross bridge for illusing the poor horse with his harness scab. Bad French I got for my pains. Of course it was frosty and the last tram. All tales of circus life are highly demoralising.</p>

			<p>BLOOM: I have forgotten for the moment. Ah, yes! <i>(He takes off his high grade hat, saluting.)</i> Dr Bloom, Leopold, dental surgeon. You have heard of von Blum Pasha. Umpteen millions. <i>Donnerwetter!</i> Owns half Austria. Egypt. Cousin.</p>

			<p>BLOOM: <i>(Scared, hats himself, steps back, then, plucking at his heart and lifting his right forearm on the square, he gives the sign and dueguard of fellowcraft.)</i> No, no, worshipful master, light of love. Mistaken identity. The Lyons mail. Lesurques and Dubosc. You remember the Childs fratricide case. We medical men. By striking him dead with a hatchet. I am wrongfully accused. Better one guilty escape than ninetynine wrongfully condemned.</p>
			<p>MARTHA: <i>(Sobbing behind her veil.)</i> Breach of promise. My real name is Peggy Griffin. He wrote to me that he was miserable. I’ll tell my brother, the Bective rugger fullback, on you, heartless flirt.</p>

			<p>SECOND WATCH: <i>(Tears in his eyes, to Bloom.)</i> You ought to be thoroughly well ashamed of yourself.</p>
			<p>BLOOM: Gentlemen of the jury, let me explain. A pure mare’s nest. I am a man misunderstood. I am being made a scapegoat of. I am a respectable married man, without a stain on my character. I live in Eccles street. My wife, I am the daughter of a most distinguished commander, a gallant upstanding gentleman, what do you call him, Majorgeneral Brian Tweedy, one of Britain’s fighting men who helped to win our battles. Got his majority for the heroic defence of Rorke’s Drift.</p>
			<p>FIRST WATCH: Regiment.</p>
			<p>BLOOM: <i>(Turns to the gallery.)</i> The royal Dublins, boys, the salt of the earth, known the world over. I think I see some old comrades in arms up there among you. The R. D. F., with our own Metropolitan police, guardians of our homes, the pluckiest lads and the finest body of men, as physique, in the service of our sovereign.</p>
			<p>A VOICE: Turncoat! Up the Boers! Who booed Joe Chamberlain?</p>
			<p>BLOOM: <i>(His hand on the shoulder of the first watch.)</i> My old dad too was a J. P. I’m as staunch a Britisher as you are, sir. I fought with the colours for king and country in the absentminded war under general Gough in the park and was disabled at Spion Kop and Bloemfontein, was mentioned in dispatches. I did all a white man could. <i>(With quiet feeling.)</i> Jim Bludso. Hold her nozzle again the bank.</p>
			<p>FIRST WATCH: Profession or trade.</p>

			<p>BEAUFOY: <i>(Drawls.)</i> No, you aren’t. Not by a long shot if I know it. I don’t see it, that’s all. No born gentleman, no-one with the most rudimentary promptings of a gentleman would stoop to such particularly loathsome conduct. One of those, my lord. A plagiarist. A soapy sneak masquerading as a literateur. It’s perfectly obvious that with the most inherent baseness he has cribbed some of my bestselling copy, really gorgeous stuff, a perfect gem, the love passages in which are beneath suspicion. The Beaufoy books of love and great possessions, with which your lordship is doubtless familiar, are a household word throughout the kingdom.</p>
			<p>BLOOM: <i>(Murmurs with hangdog meekness glum.)</i> That bit about the laughing witch hand in hand I take exception to, if I may...</p>
			<p>BEAUFOY: <i>(His lip upcurled, smiles superciliously on the court.)</i> You funny ass, you! You’re too beastly awfully weird for words!

I presume, my lord, we shall receive the usual witnesses’ fees, shan’t we? We are considerably out of pocket over this bally pressman johnny, this jackdaw of Rheims, who has not even been to a university.</p>
			<p>BLOOM: <i>(Indistinctly.)</i> University of life. Bad art.</p>
			<p>BEAUFOY: <i>(Shouts.)</i> It’s a damnably foul lie, showing the moral rottenness of the man! <i>(He extends his portfolio.)</i> We have here damning evidence, the <i>corpus delicti</i>, my lord, a specimen of my maturer work disfigured by the hallmark of the beast.</p>

			<p><i>(Mary Driscoll, a slipshod servant girl, approaches. She has a bucket on the crook of her arm and a scouringbrush in her hand.)</i></p>
			<p>SECOND WATCH: Another! Are you of the unfortunate class?</p>
			<p>MARY DRISCOLL: <i>(Indignantly.)</i> I’m not a bad one. I bear a respectable character and was four months in my last place. I was in a situation, six pounds a year and my chances with Fridays out and I had to leave owing to his carryings on.</p>
			<p>FIRST WATCH: What do you tax him with?</p>
			<p>MARY DRISCOLL: He made a certain suggestion but I thought more of myself as poor as I am.</p>
			<p>BLOOM: <i>(In housejacket of ripplecloth, flannel trousers, heelless slippers, unshaven, his hair rumpled: softly.)</i> I treated you white. I gave you mementos, smart emerald garters far above your station. Incautiously I took your part when you were accused of pilfering. There’s a medium in all things. Play cricket.</p>
			<p>MARY DRISCOLL: <i>(Excitedly.)</i> As God is looking down on me this night if ever I laid a hand to them oylsters!</p>
			<p>FIRST WATCH: The offence complained of? Did something happen?</p>
			<p>MARY DRISCOLL: He surprised me in the rere of the premises, Your honour, when the missus was out shopping one morning with a request for a safety pin. He held me and I was discoloured in four places as a result. And he interfered twict with my clothing.</p>
			<p>BLOOM: She counterassaulted.</p>
			<p>MARY DRISCOLL: <i>(Scornfully.)</i> I had more respect for the scouringbrush, so I had. I remonstrated with him, Your lord, and he remarked: keep it quiet.</p>
			<p><i>(General laughter.)</i></p>
			<p>GEORGE FOTTRELL: <i>(Clerk of the crown and peace, resonantly.)</i> Order in court! The accused will now make a bogus statement.</p>
			<p><i>(Bloom, pleading not guilty and holding a fullblown waterlily, begins a long unintelligible speech. They would hear what counsel had to say in his stirring address to the grand jury. He was down and out but, though branded as a black sheep, if he might say so, he meant to reform, to retrieve the memory of the past in a purely sisterly way and return to nature as a purely domestic animal. A sevenmonths’ child, he had been carefully brought up and nurtured by an aged bedridden parent. There might have been lapses of an erring father but he wanted to turn over a new leaf and now, when at long last in sight of the whipping post, to lead a homely life in the evening of his days, permeated by the affectionate surroundings of the heaving bosom of the family. An acclimatised Britisher, he had seen that summer eve from the footplate of an engine cab of the Loop line railway company while the rain refrained from falling glimpses, as it were, through the windows of loveful households in Dublin city and urban district of scenes truly rural of happiness of the better land with Dockrell’s wallpaper at one and ninepence a dozen, innocent Britishborn bairns lisping prayers to the Sacred Infant, youthful scholars grappling with their pensums or model young ladies playing on the pianoforte or anon all with fervour reciting the family rosary round the crackling Yulelog while in the boreens and green lanes the colleens with their swains strolled what times the strains of the organtoned melodeon Britannia metalbound with four acting stops and twelvefold bellows, a sacrifice, greatest bargain ever....</i></p>

			<p>J. J. O’MOLLOY: <i>(In barrister’s grey wig and stuffgown, speaking with a voice of pained protest.)</i> This is no place for indecent levity at the expense of an erring mortal disguised in liquor. We are not in a beargarden nor at an Oxford rag nor is this a travesty of justice. My client is an infant, a poor foreign immigrant who started scratch as a stowaway and is now trying to turn an honest penny. The trumped up misdemeanour was due to a momentary aberration of heredity, brought on by hallucination, such familiarities as the alleged guilty occurrence being quite permitted in my client’s native place, the land of the Pharaoh. <i>Prima facie</i>, I put it to you that there was no attempt at carnally knowing. Intimacy did not occur and the offence complained of by Driscoll, that her virtue was solicited, was not repeated. I would deal in especial with atavism. There have been cases of shipwreck and somnambulism in my client’s family. If the accused could speak he could a tale unfold—one of the strangest that have ever been narrated between the covers of a book. He himself, my lord, is a physical wreck from cobbler’s weak chest. His submission is that he is of Mongolian extraction and irresponsible for his actions. Not all there, in fact.</p>

			<p>J. J. O’MOLLOY: <i>(Hotly to the populace.)</i> This is a lonehand fight. By Hades, I will not have any client of mine gagged and badgered in this fashion by a pack of curs and laughing hyenas. The Mosaic code has superseded the law of the jungle. I say it and I say it emphatically, without wishing for one moment to defeat the ends of justice, accused was not accessory before the act and prosecutrix has not been tampered with. The young person was treated by defendant as if she were his very own daughter. <i>(Bloom takes J. J.

My client, an innately bashful man, would be the last man in the world to do anything ungentlemanly which injured modesty could object to or cast a stone at a girl who took the wrong turning when some dastard, responsible for her condition, had worked his own sweet will on her. He wants to go straight. I regard him as the whitest man I know. He is down on his luck at present owing to the mortgaging of his extensive property at Agendath Netaim in faraway Asia Minor, slides of which will now be shown. <i>(To Bloom.)</i> I suggest that you will do the handsome thing.</p>

He said that he had seen from the gods my peerless globes as I sat in a box of the <i>Theatre Royal</i> at a command performance of <i>La Cigale</i>. I deeply inflamed him, he said. He made improper overtures to me to misconduct myself at half past four p.m. on the following Thursday, Dunsink time.

Because he closed my carriage door outside sir Thornley Stoker’s one sleety day during the cold snap of February ninetythree when even the grid of the wastepipe and the ballstop in my bath cistern were frozen. Subsequently he enclosed a bloom of edelweiss culled on the heights, as he said, in my honour.

He lauded almost extravagantly my nether extremities, my swelling calves in silk hose drawn up to the limit, and eulogised glowingly my other hidden treasures in priceless lace which, he said, he could conjure up. He urged me (Stating that he felt it his mission in life to urge me.) to defile the marriage bed, to commit adultery at the earliest possible opportunity.</p>

My eyes, I know, shone divinely as I watched Captain Slogger Dennehy of the Inniskillings win the final chukkar on his darling cob <i>Centaur.</i> This plebeian Don Juan observed me from behind a hackney car and sent me in double envelopes an obscene photograph, such as are sold after dark on Paris boulevards, insulting to any lady. I have it still. It represents a partially nude señorita, frail and lovely (his wife, as he solemnly assured me, taken by him from nature), practising illicit intercourse with a muscular torero, evidently a blackguard. He urged me to do likewise, to misbehave, to sin with officers of the garrison. He implored me to soil his letter in an unspeakable manner, to chastise him as he richly deserves, to bestride and ride him, to give him a most vicious horsewhipping.</p>

			<p>BLOOM: <i>(In workman’s corduroy overalls, black gansy with red floating tie and apache cap.)</i> Mankind is incorrigible. Sir Walter Ralegh brought from the new world that potato and that weed, the one a killer of pestilence by absorption, the other a poisoner of the ear, eye, heart, memory, will, understanding, all.

All the windows are thronged with sightseers, chiefly ladies. Along the route the regiments of the Royal Dublin Fusiliers, the King’s own Scottish Borderers, the Cameron Highlanders and the Welsh Fusiliers, standing to attention, keep back the crowd. Boys from High school are perched on the lampposts, telegraph poles, windowsills, cornices, gutters, chimneypots, railings, rainspouts, whistling and cheering. The pillar of the cloud appears. A fife and drum band is heard in the distance playing the Kol Nidre. The beaters approach with imperial eagles hoisted, trailing banners and waving oriental palms. The chryselephantine papal standard rises high, surrounded by pennons of the civic flag. The van of the procession appears headed by John Howard Parnell, city marshal, in a chessboard tabard, the Athlone Poursuivant and Ulster King of Arms. They are followed by the Right Honourable Joseph Hutchinson, lord mayor of Dublin, his lordship the lord mayor of Cork, their worships the mayors of Limerick, Galway, Sligo and Waterford, twentyeight Irish representative peers, sirdars, grandees and maharajahs bearing the cloth of estate, the Dublin Metropolitan Fire Brigade, the chapter of the saints of finance in their plutocratic order of precedence, the bishop of Down and Connor, His Eminence Michael cardinal Logue, archbishop of Armagh, primate of all Ireland, His Grace, the most reverend Dr William Alexander, archbishop of Armagh, primate of all Ireland, the chief rabbi, the presbyterian moderator, the heads of the baptist, anabaptist, methodist and Moravian chapels and the honorary secretary of the society of friends.

After them march gentlemen of the bedchamber, Black Rod, Deputy Garter, Gold Stick, the master of horse, the lord great chamberlain, the earl marshal, the high constable carrying the sword of state, saint Stephen’s iron crown, the chalice and bible. Four buglers on foot blow a sennet. Beefeaters reply, winding clarions of welcome. Under an arch of triumph Bloom appears, bareheaded, in a crimson velvet mantle trimmed with ermine, bearing Saint Edward’s staff, the orb and sceptre with the dove, the curtana. He is seated on a milkwhite horse with long flowing crimson tail, richly caparisoned, with golden headstall. Wild excitement. The ladies from their balconies throw down rosepetals. The air is perfumed with essences. The men cheer. Bloom’s boys run amid the bystanders with branches of hawthorn and wrenbushes.)</i></p>

			<p>WILLIAM, ARCHBISHOP OF ARMAGH: <i>(In purple stock and shovel hat.)</i> Will you to your power cause law and mercy to be executed in all your judgments in Ireland and territories thereunto belonging?</p>
			<p>BLOOM: <i>(Placing his right hand on his testicles, swears.)</i> So may the Creator deal with me. All this I promise to do.</p>

			<p><i>(Bloom assumes a mantle of cloth of gold and puts on a ruby ring. He ascends and stands on the stone of destiny. The representative peers put on at the same time their twentyeight crowns.

			<p>BLOOM: My subjects! We hereby nominate our faithful charger Copula Felix hereditary Grand Vizier and announce that we have this day repudiated our former spouse and have bestowed our royal hand upon the princess Selene, the splendour of night.</p>
			<p><i>(The former morganatic spouse of Bloom is hastily removed in the Black Maria. The princess Selene, in moonblue robes, a silver crescent on her head, descends from a Sedan chair, borne by two giants. An outburst of cheering.)</i></p>

			<p>TOM KERNAN: You deserve it, your honour.</p>
			<p>BLOOM: On this day twenty years ago we overcame the hereditary enemy at Ladysmith. Our howitzers and camel swivel guns played on his lines with telling effect. Half a league onward! They charge! All is lost now! Do we yield? No! We drive them headlong! Lo! We charge! Deploying to the left our light horse swept across the heights of Plevna and, uttering their warcry <i>Bonafide Sabaoth</i>, sabred the Saracen gunners to a man.</p>

			<p><i>(Thirtytwo workmen, wearing rosettes, from all the counties of Ireland, under the guidance of Derwan the builder, construct the new Bloomusalem. It is a colossal edifice with crystal roof, built in the shape of a huge pork kidney, containing forty thousand rooms. In the course of its extension several buildings and monuments are demolished. Government offices are temporarily transferred to railway sheds. Numerous houses are razed to the ground. The inhabitants are lodged in barrels and boxes, all marked in red with the letters: L. B. Several paupers fall from a ladder. A part of the walls of Dublin, crowded with loyal sightseers, collapses.)</i></p>

			<p><i>(A cannonshot. The man in the macintosh disappears. Bloom with his sceptre strikes down poppies.

Fellowcountrymen, <i>sgenl inn ban bata coisde gan capall.</i> I call on my old friend, Dr Malachi Mulligan, sex specialist, to give medical testimony on my behalf.</p>
			<p>DR MULLIGAN: <i>(In motor jerkin, green motorgoggles on his brow.)</i> Dr Bloom is bisexually abnormal. He has recently escaped from Dr Eustace’s private asylum for demented gentlemen. Born out of bedlock hereditary epilepsy is present, the consequence of unbridled lust. Traces of elephantiasis have been discovered among his ascendants. There are marked symptoms of chronic exhibitionism. Ambidexterity is also latent. He is prematurely bald from selfabuse, perversely idealistic in consequence, a reformed rake, and has metal teeth. In consequence of a family complex he has temporarily lost his memory and I believe him to be more sinned against than sinning. I have made a pervaginal examination and, after application of the acid test to 5427 anal, axillary, pectoral and pubic hairs, I declare him to be <i>virgo intacta.</i></p>
			<p><i>(Bloom holds his high grade hat over his genital organs.)</i></p>
			<p>DR MADDEN: Hypsospadia is also marked. In the interest of coming generations I suggest that the parts affected should be preserved in spirits of wine in the national teratological museum.</p>
			<p>DR CROTTHERS: I have examined the patient’s urine. It is albuminoid. Salivation is insufficient, the patellar reflex intermittent.</p>
			<p>DR PUNCH COSTELLO: The <i>fetor judaicus</i> is most perceptible.</p>
			<p>DR DIXON: <i>(Reads a bill of health.)</i> Professor Bloom is a finished example of the new womanly man. His moral nature is simple and lovable. Many have found him a dear man, a dear person. He is a rather quaint fellow on the whole, coy though not feebleminded in the medical sense. He has written a really beautiful letter, a poem in itself, to the court missionary of the Reformed Priests’ Protection Society which clears up everything. He is practically a total abstainer and I can affirm that he sleeps on a straw litter and eats the most Spartan food, cold dried grocer’s peas. He wears a hairshirt of pure Irish manufacture winter and summer and scourges himself every Saturday. He was, I understand, at one time a firstclass misdemeanant in Glencree reformatory. Another report states that he was a very posthumous child. I appeal for clemency in the name of the most sacred word our vocal organs have ever been called upon to speak. He is about to have a baby.</p>

			<p>ZOE: <i>(Her lucky hand instantly saving him.)</i> Hoopsa! Don’t fall upstairs.</p>
			<p>BLOOM: The just man falls seven times. <i>(He stands aside at the threshold.)</i> After you is good manners.</p>
			<p>ZOE: Ladies first, gentlemen after.</p>
			<p><i>(She crosses the threshold. He hesitates. She turns and, holding out her hands, draws him over. He hops. On the antlered rack of the hall hang a man’s hat and waterproof. Bloom uncovers himself but, seeing them, frowns, then smiles, preoccupied. A door on the return landing is flung open. A man in purple shirt and grey trousers, brownsocked, passes with an ape’s gait, his bald head and goatee beard upheld, hugging a full waterjugjar, his twotailed black braces dangling at heels. Averting his face quickly Bloom bends to examine on the halltable the spaniel eyes of a running fox: then, his lifted head sniffing, follows Zoe into the musicroom. A shade of mauve tissuepaper dims the light of the chandelier. Round and round a moth flies, colliding, escaping. The floor is covered with an oilcloth mosaic of jade and azure and cinnabar rhomboids. Footmarks are stamped over it in all senses, heel to heel, heel to hollow, toe to toe, feet locked, a morris of shuffling feet without body phantoms, all in a scrimmage higgledypiggledy. The walls are tapestried with a paper of yewfronds and clear glades. In the grate is spread a screen of peacock feathers. Lynch squats crosslegged on the hearthrug of matted hair, his cap back to the front. With a wand he beats time slowly. Kitty Ricketts, a bony pallid whore in navy costume, doeskin gloves rolled back from a coral wristlet, a chain purse in her hand, sits perched on the edge of the table swinging her leg and glancing at herself in the gilt mirror over the mantelpiece. A tag of her corsetlace hangs slightly below her jacket. Lynch indicates mockingly the couple at the piano.)</i></p>
			<p>KITTY: <i>(Coughs behind her hand.)</i> She’s a bit imbecillic. <i>(She signs with a waggling forefinger.)</i> Blemblem. <i>(Lynch lifts up her skirt and white petticoat with the wand. She settles them down quickly.)</i> Respect yourself. <i>(She hiccups, then bends quickly her sailor hat under which her hair glows, red with henna.)</i> O, excuse!</p>
			<p>ZOE: More limelight, Charley. <i>(She goes to the chandelier and turns the gas full cock.)</i></p>
			<p>KITTY: <i>(Peers at the gasjet.)</i> What ails it tonight?</p>
			<p>LYNCH: <i>(Deeply.)</i> Enter a ghost and hobgoblins.</p>
			<p>ZOE: Clap on the back for Zoe.</p>
			<p><i>(The wand in Lynch’s hand flashes: a brass poker. Stephen stands at the pianola on which sprawl his hat and ashplant. With two fingers he repeats once more the series of empty fifths. Florry Talbot, a blond feeble goosefat whore in a tatterdemalion gown of mildewed strawberry, lolls spreadeagle in the sofacorner, her limp forearm pendent over the bolster, listening. A heavy stye droops over her sleepy eyelid.)</i></p>
			<p>KITTY: <i>(Hiccups again with a kick of her horsed foot.)</i> O, excuse!</p>
			<p>ZOE: <i>(Promptly.)</i> Your boy’s thinking of you. Tie a knot on your shift.</p>
			<p><i>(Kitty Ricketts bends her head. Her boa uncoils, slides, glides over her shoulder, back, arm, chair to the ground. Lynch lifts the curled catterpillar on his wand. She snakes her neck, nestling. Stephen glances behind at the squatted figure with its cap back to the front.)</i></p>
			<p>STEPHEN: As a matter of fact it is of no importance whether Benedetto Marcello found it or made it. The rite is the poet’s rest. It may be an old hymn to Demeter or also illustrate <i>Cœla enarrant gloriam Domini.</i> It is susceptible of nodes or modes as far apart as hyperphrygian and mixolydian and of texts so divergent as priests haihooping round David’s that is Circe’s or what am I saying Ceres’ altar and David’s tip from the stable to his chief bassoonist about the alrightness of his almightiness. <i>Mais nom de nom,</i> that is another pair of trousers. <i>Jetez la gourme. Faut que jeunesse se passe. (He stops, points at Lynch’s cap, smiles, laughs.)</i> Which side is your knowledge bump?</p>
			<p>THE CAP: <i>(With saturnine spleen.)</i> Bah! It is because it is. Woman’s reason. Jewgreek is greekjew. Extremes meet. Death is the highest form of life. Bah!</p>
			<p>STEPHEN: You remember fairly accurately all my errors, boasts, mistakes. How long shall I continue to close my eyes to disloyalty? Whetstone!</p>
			<p>THE CAP: Bah!</p>
			<p>STEPHEN: Here’s another for you. <i>(He frowns.)</i> The reason is because the fundamental and the dominant are separated by the greatest possible interval which...</p>
			<p>THE CAP: Which? Finish. You can’t.</p>
			<p>STEPHEN: <i>(With an effort.)</i> Interval which. Is the greatest possible ellipse. Consistent with. The ultimate return. The octave. Which.</p>
			<p>THE CAP: Which?</p>
			<p><i>(Outside the gramophone begins to blare</i> The Holy City.)</p>
			<p>STEPHEN: <i>(Abruptly.)</i> What went forth to the ends of the world to traverse not itself, God, the sun, Shakespeare, a commercial traveller, having itself traversed in reality itself becomes that self. Wait a moment. Wait a second. Damn that fellow’s noise in the street. Self which it itself was ineluctably preconditioned to become. <i>Ecco!</i></p>
			<p>LYNCH: <i>(With a mocking whinny of laughter grins at Bloom and Zoe Higgins.)</i> What a learned speech, eh?</p>
			<p>ZOE: <i>(Briskly.)</i> God help your head, he knows more than you have forgotten.</p>
			<p><i>(With obese stupidity Florry Talbot regards Stephen.)</i></p>
			<p>FLORRY: They say the last day is coming this summer.</p>
			<p>KITTY: No!</p>
			<p>ZOE: <i>(Explodes in laughter.)</i> Great unjust God!</p>
			<p>FLORRY: <i>(Offended.)</i> Well, it was in the papers about Antichrist. O, my foot’s tickling.</p>
			<p><i>(Ragged barefoot newsboys, jogging a wagtail kite, patter past, yelling.)</i></p>
			<p>THE NEWSBOYS: Stop press edition. Result of the rockinghorse races. Sea serpent in the royal canal. Safe arrival of Antichrist.</p>
			<p><i>(Stephen turns and sees Bloom.)</i></p>
			<p>STEPHEN: A time, times and half a time.</p>
			<p><i>(Reuben J Antichrist, wandering jew, a clutching hand open on his spine, stumps forward. Across his loins is slung a pilgrim’s wallet from which protrude promissory notes and dishonoured bills. Aloft over his shoulder he bears a long boatpole from the hook of which the sodden huddled mass of his only son, saved from Liffey waters, hangs from the slack of its breeches. A hobgoblin in the image of Punch Costello, hipshot, crookbacked, hydrocephalic, prognathic with receding forehead and Ally Sloper nose, tumbles in somersaults through the gathering darkness.)</i></p>
			<p>ALL: What?</p>
			<p>THE HOBGOBLIN: <i>(His jaws chattering, capers to and fro, goggling his eyes, squeaking, kangaroohopping with outstretched clutching arms, then all at once thrusts his lipless face through the fork of his thighs.) Il vient! C’est moi! L’homme qui rit! L’homme primigène! (He whirls round and round with dervish howls.) Sieurs et dames, faites vos jeux! (He crouches juggling. Tiny roulette planets fly from his hands.) Les jeux sont faits! (The planets rush together, uttering crepitant cracks.) Rien va plus! (The planets, buoyant balloons, sail swollen up and away. He springs off into vacuum.)</i></p>
			<p>FLORRY: <i>(Sinking into torpor, crossing herself secretly.)</i> The end of the world!</p>
			<p><i>(A female tepid effluvium leaks out from her. Nebulous obscurity occupies space. Through the drifting fog without the gramophone blares over coughs and feetshuffling.)</i></p>

			<p>KITTY-KATE: I forgot myself. In a weak moment I erred and did what I did on Constitution hill. I was confirmed by the bishop and enrolled in the brown scapular. My mother’s sister married a Montmorency. It was a working plumber was my ruination when I was pure.</p>
			<p>ZOE-FANNY: I let him larrup it into me for the fun of it.</p>
			<p>FLORRY-TERESA: It was in consequence of a portwine beverage on top of Hennessy’s three star. I was guilty with Whelan when he slipped into the bed.</p>
			<p>STEPHEN: In the beginning was the word, in the end the world without end. Blessed be the eight beatitudes.</p>
			<p><i>(The beatitudes, Dixon, Madden, Crotthers, Costello, Lenehan, Bannon, Mulligan and Lynch in white surgical students’ gowns, four abreast, goosestepping, tramp fast past in noisy marching.)</i></p>
			<p>THE BEATITUDES: <i>(Incoherently.)</i> Beer beef battledog buybull businum barnum buggerum bishop.</p>
			<p>LYSTER: <i>(In quakergrey kneebreeches and broadbrimmed hat, says discreetly.)</i> He is our friend. I need not mention names. Seek thou the light.</p>

			<p>BEST: <i>(Smiling, lifts the hat and displays a shaven poll from the crown of which bristles a pigtail toupee tied with an orange topknot.)</i> I was just beautifying him, don’t you know. A thing of beauty, don’t you know, Yeats says, or I mean, Keats says.</p>
			<p>JOHN EGLINTON: <i>(Produces a greencapped dark lantern and flashes it towards a corner: with carping accent.)</i> Esthetics and cosmetics are for the boudoir. I am out for truth. Plain truth for a plain man. Tanderagee wants the facts and means to get them.</p>
			<p><i>(In the cone of the searchlight behind the coalscuttle, ollave, holyeyed, the bearded figure of Mananaun MacLir broods, chin on knees. He rises slowly. A cold seawind blows from his druid mouth. About his head writhe eels and elvers. He is encrusted with weeds and shells. His right hand holds a bicycle pump. His left hand grasps a huge crayfish by its two talons.)</i></p>
			<p>MANANAUN MACLIR: <i>(With a voice of waves.)</i> Aum! Hek! Wal! Ak! Lub! Mor! Ma! White yoghin of the gods. Occult pimander of Hermes Trismegistos. <i>(With a voice of whistling seawind.)</i> Punarjanam patsypunjaub! I won’t have my leg pulled. It has been said by one: beware the left, the cult of Shakti. <i>(With a cry of stormbirds.)</i> Shakti Shiva, darkhidden Father! <i>(He smites with his bicycle pump the crayfish in his left hand. On its cooperative dial glow the twelve signs of the zodiac. He wails with the vehemence of the ocean.)</i> Aum! Baum! Pyjaum! I am the light of the homestead! I am the dreamery creamery butter.</p>

			<p>LYNCH: I’m not looking</p>
			<p>ZOE: <i>(Makes sheep’s eyes.)</i> No? You wouldn’t do a less thing. Would you suck a lemon?</p>
			<p><i>(Squinting in mock shame she glances with sidelong meaning at Bloom, then twists round towards him, pulling her slip free of the poker. Blue fluid again flows over her flesh. Bloom stands, smiling desirously, twirling his thumbs. Kitty Ricketts licks her middle finger with her spittle and, gazing in the mirror, smooths both eyebrows. Lipoti Virag, basilicogrammate, chutes rapidly down through the chimneyflue and struts two steps to the left on gawky pink stilts. He is sausaged into several overcoats and wears a brown macintosh under which he holds a roll of parchment. In his left eye flashes the monocle of Cashel Boyle O’Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell. On his head is perched an Egyptian pshent. Two quills project over his ears.)</i></p>
			<p>VIRAG: <i>(Heels together, bows.)</i> My name is Virag Lipoti, of Szombathely. <i>(He coughs thoughtfully, drily.)</i> Promiscuous nakedness is much in evidence hereabouts, eh? Inadvertently her backview revealed the fact that she is not wearing those rather intimate garments of which you are a particular devotee. The injection mark on the thigh I hope you perceived? Good.</p>
			<p>BLOOM: Granpapachi. But...</p>
			<p>VIRAG: Number two on the other hand, she of the cherry rouge and coiffeuse white, whose hair owes not a little to our tribal elixir of gopherwood, is in walking costume and tightly staysed by her sit, I should opine. Backbone in front, so to say. Correct me but I always understood that the act so performed by skittish humans with glimpses of lingerie appealed to you in virtue of its exhibitionististicicity. In a word. Hippogriff. Am I right?</p>
			<p>BLOOM: She is rather lean.</p>
			<p>VIRAG: <i>(Not unpleasantly.)</i> Absolutely! Well observed and those pannier pockets of the skirt and slightly pegtop effect are devised to suggest bunchiness of hip. A new purchase at some monster sale for which a gull has been mulcted. Meretricious finery to deceive the eye. Observe the attention to details of dustspecks. Never put on you tomorrow what you can wear today. Parallax! <i>(With a nervous twitch of his head.)</i> Did you hear my brain go snap? Pollysyllabax!</p>
			<p>BLOOM: <i>(An elbow resting in a hand, a forefinger against his cheek.)</i> She seems sad.</p>
			<p>VIRAG: <i>(Cynically, his weasel teeth bared yellow, draws down his left eye with a finger and barks hoarsely.)</i> Hoax! Beware of the flapper and bogus mournful. Lily of the alley. All possess bachelor’s button discovered by Rualdus Columbus. Tumble her. Columble her. Chameleon. <i>(More genially.)</i> Well then, permit me to draw your attention to item number three. There is plenty of her visible to the naked eye. Observe the mass of oxygenated vegetable matter on her skull. What ho, she bumps! The ugly duckling of the party, longcasted and deep in keel.</p>
			<p>BLOOM: <i>(Regretfully.)</i> When you come out without your gun.</p>
			<p>VIRAG: We can do you all brands, mild, medium and strong. Pay your money, take your choice. How happy could you be with either...</p>
			<p>BLOOM: With...?</p>
			<p>VIRAG: <i>(His tongue upcurling.)</i> Lyum! Look. Her beam is broad. She is coated with quite a considerable layer of fat. Obviously mammal in weight of bosom you remark that she has in front well to the fore two protuberances of very respectable dimensions, inclined to fall in the noonday soupplate, while on her rere lower down are two additional protuberances, suggestive of potent rectum and tumescent for palpation, which leave nothing to be desired save compactness. Such fleshy parts are the product of careful nurture. When coopfattened their livers reach an elephantine size. Pellets of new bread with fennygreek and gumbenjamin swamped down by potions of green tea endow them during their brief existence with natural pincushions of quite colossal blubber. That suits your book, eh? Fleshhotpots of Egypt to hanker after. Wallow in it. Lycopodium. <i>(His throat twitches.)</i> Slapbang! There he goes again.</p>
			<p>BLOOM: The stye I dislike.</p>
			<p>VIRAG: <i>(Arches his eyebrows.)</i> Contact with a goldring, they say. <i>Argumentum ad feminam</i>, as we said in old Rome and ancient Greece in the consulship of Diplodocus and Ichthyosauros. For the rest Eve’s sovereign remedy. Not for sale. Hire only. Huguenot. <i>(He twitches.)</i> It is a funny sound. <i>(He coughs encouragingly.)</i> But possibly it is only a wart. I presume you shall have remembered what I will have taught you on that head? Wheatenmeal with honey and nutmeg.</p>
			<p>BLOOM: <i>(Reflecting.)</i> Wheatenmeal with lycopodium and syllabax. This searching ordeal. It has been an unusually fatiguing day, a chapter of accidents. Wait. I mean, wartsblood spreads warts, you said...</p>
			<p>VIRAG: <i>(Severely, his nose hardhumped, his side eye winking.)</i> Stop twirling your thumbs and have a good old thunk. See, you have forgotten. Exercise your mnemotechnic. <i>La causa è santa</i>. Tara. Tara. <i>(Aside.)</i> He will surely remember.</p>
			<p>BLOOM: Rosemary also did I understand you to say or willpower over parasitic tissues. Then nay no I have an inkling. The touch of a deadhand cures. Mnemo?</p>
			<p>VIRAG: <i>(Excitedly.)</i> I say so. I say so. E’en so. Technic. <i>(He taps his parchmentroll energetically.)</i> This book tells you how to act with all descriptive particulars. Consult index for agitated fear of aconite, melancholy of muriatic, priapic pulsatilla. Virag is going to talk about amputation. Our old friend caustic. They must be starved. Snip off with horsehair under the denned neck. But, to change the venue to the Bulgar and the Basque, have you made up your mind whether you like or dislike women in male habiliments? <i>(With a dry snigger.)</i> You intended to devote an entire year to the study of the religious problem and the summer months of 1886 to square the circle and win that million. Pomegranate! From the sublime to the ridiculous is but a step. Pyjamas, let us say? Or stockingette gussetted knickers, closed? Or, put we the case, those complicated combinations, camiknickers? <i>(He crows derisively.)</i> Keekeereekee!</p>
			<p><i>(Bloom surveys uncertainly the three whores then gazes at the veiled mauve light, hearing the everflying moth.)</i></p>
			<p>BLOOM: I wanted then to have now concluded. Nightdress was never. Hence this. But tomorrow is a new day will be. Past was is today. What now is will then morrow as now was be past yester.</p>
			<p>VIRAG: <i>(Prompts in a pig’s whisper.)</i> Insects of the day spend their brief existence in reiterated coition, lured by the smell of the inferiorly pulchritudinous female possessing extendified pudendal nerve in dorsal region. Pretty Poll! <i>(His yellow parrotbeak gabbles nasally.)</i> They had a proverb in the Carpathians in or about the year five thousand five hundred and fifty of our era. One tablespoonful of honey will attract friend Bruin more than half a dozen barrels of first choice malt vinegar. Bear’s buzz bothers bees. But of this apart. At another time we may resume. We were very pleased, we others. <i>(He coughs and, bending his brow, rubs his nose thoughtfully with a scooping hand.)</i> You shall find that these night insects follow the light. An illusion for remember their complex unadjustable eye. For all these knotty points see the seventeenth book of my Fundamentals of Sexology or the Love Passion which Doctor L. B. says is the book sensation of the year. Some, to example, there are again whose movements are automatic. Perceive. That is his appropriate sun. Nightbird nightsun nighttown. Chase me, Charley! <i>(He blows into Bloom’s ear.)</i> Buzz!</p>
			<p>BLOOM: Bee or bluebottle too other day butting shadow on wall dazed self then me wandered dazed down shirt good job I...</p>
			<p>VIRAG: <i>(His face impassive, laughs in a rich feminine key.)</i> Splendid! Spanish fly in his fly or mustard plaster on his dibble. <i>(He gobbles gluttonously with turkey wattles.)</i> Bubbly jock! Bubbly jock! Where are we? Open Sesame! Cometh forth! <i>(He unrolls his parchment rapidly and reads, his glowworm’s nose running backwards over the letters which he claws.)</i> Stay, good friend. I bring thee thy answer. Redbank oysters will shortly be upon us. I’m the best o’cook. Those succulent bivalves may help us and the truffles of Perigord, tubers dislodged through mister omnivorous porker, were unsurpassed in cases of nervous debility or viragitis. Though they stink yet they sting. <i>(He wags his head with cackling raillery.)</i> Jocular. With my eyeglass in my ocular. <i>(He sneezes.)</i> Amen!</p>
			<p>BLOOM: <i>(Absently.)</i> Ocularly woman’s bivalve case is worse. Always open sesame. The cloven sex. Why they fear vermin, creeping things. Yet Eve and the serpent contradicts. Not a historical fact. Obvious analogy to my idea. Serpents too are gluttons for woman’s milk. Wind their way through miles of omnivorous forest to sucksucculent her breast dry. Like those bubblyjocular Roman matrons one reads of in Elephantuliasis.</p>
			<p>VIRAG: <i>(His mouth projected in hard wrinkles, eyes stonily forlornly closed, psalms in outlandish monotone.)</i> That the cows with their those distended udders that they have been the the known...</p>
			<p>BLOOM: I am going to scream. I beg your pardon. Ah? So. <i>(He repeats.)</i> Spontaneously to seek out the saurian’s lair in order to entrust their teats to his avid suction. Ant milks aphis. <i>(Profoundly.)</i> Instinct rules the world. In life. In death.</p>
			<p>VIRAG: <i>(Head askew, arches his back and hunched wingshoulders, peers at the moth out of blear bulged eyes, points a horning claw and cries.)</i> Who’s moth moth? Who’s dear Gerald? Dear Ger, that you? O dear, he is Gerald. O, I much fear he shall be most badly burned. Will some pleashe pershon not now impediment so catastrophics mit agitation of firstclass tablenumpkin? <i>(He mews.)</i> Puss puss puss puss! <i>(He sighs, draws back and stares sideways down with dropping underjaw.)</i> Well, well. He doth rest anon. (He snaps his jaws suddenly on the air.)</p>

Who was it told me his name? <i>(His lawnmower begins to purr.)</i> Aha, yes. <i>Zoe mou sas agapo</i>. Have a notion I was here before. When was it not Atkinson his card I have somewhere. Mac Somebody. Unmack I have it. He told me about, hold on, Swinburne, was it, no?</p>
			<p>FLORRY: And the song?</p>
			<p>STEPHEN: Spirit is willing but the flesh is weak.</p>
			<p>FLORRY: Are you out of Maynooth? You’re like someone I knew once.</p>
			<p>STEPHEN: Out of it now. <i>(To himself.)</i> Clever.</p>
			<p>PHILIP DRUNK AND PHILIP SOBER: <i>(Their lawnmowers purring with a rigadoon of grasshalms.)</i> Clever ever. Out of it out of it. By the bye have you the book, the thing, the ashplant? Yes, there it, yes. Cleverever outofitnow. Keep in condition. Do like us.</p>
			<p>ZOE: There was a priest down here two nights ago to do his bit of business with his coat buttoned up. You needn’t try to hide, I says to him. I know you’ve a Roman collar.</p>
			<p>VIRAG: Perfectly logical from his standpoint. Fall of man. <i>(Harshly, his pupils waxing.)</i> To hell with the pope! Nothing new under the sun. I am the Virag who disclosed the Sex Secrets of Monks and Maidens. Why I left the church of Rome. Read the Priest, the Woman and the Confessional. Penrose. Flipperty Jippert. <i>(He wriggles.)</i> Woman, undoing with sweet pudor her belt of rushrope, offers her allmoist yoni to man’s lingam. Short time after man presents woman with pieces of jungle meat. Woman shows joy and covers herself with featherskins. Man loves her yoni fiercely with big lingam, the stiff one. <i>(He cries.) Coactus volui.</i> Then giddy woman will run about. Strong man grapses woman’s wrist. Woman squeals, bites, spucks. Man, now fierce angry, strikes woman’s fat yadgana. <i>(He chases his tail.)</i> Piffpaff! Popo! <i>(He stops, sneezes.)</i> Pchp! <i>(He worries his butt.)</i> Prrrrrht!</p>
			<p>LYNCH: I hope you gave the good father a penance. Nine glorias for shooting a bishop.</p>
			<p>ZOE: <i>(Spouts walrus smoke through her nostrils.)</i> He couldn’t get a connection. Only, you know, sensation. A dry rush.</p>
			<p>BLOOM: Poor man!</p>
			<p>ZOE: <i>(Lightly.)</i> Only for what happened him.</p>
			<p>BLOOM: How?</p>
			<p>VIRAG: <i>(A diabolic rictus of black luminosity contracting his visage, cranes his scraggy neck forward. He lifts a mooncalf nozzle and howls.) Verfluchte Goim!</i> He had a father, forty fathers. He never existed. Pig God! He had two left feet. He was Judas Iacchia, a Libyan eunuch, the pope’s bastard. <i>(He leans out on tortured forepaws, elbows bent rigid, his eye agonising in his flat skullneck and yelps over the mute world.)</i> A son of a whore. Apocalypse.</p>
			<p>KITTY: And Mary Shortall that was in the lock with the pox she got from Jimmy Pidgeon in the blue caps had a child off him that couldn’t swallow and was smothered with the convulsions in the mattress and we all subscribed for the funeral.</p>
			<p>PHILIP DRUNK: <i>(Gravely.) Qui vous a mis dans cette fichue position, Philippe?</i></p>
			<p>PHILIP SOBER: <i>(Gaily.) C’était le sacré pigeon, Philippe.</i></p>
			<p><i>(Kitty unpins her hat and sets it down calmly, patting her henna hair. And a prettier, a daintier head of winsome curls was never seen on a whore’s shoulders. Lynch puts on her hat. She whips it off.)</i></p>
			<p>LYNCH: <i>(Laughs.)</i> And to such delights has Metchnikoff inoculated anthropoid apes.</p>
			<p>FLORRY: <i>(Nods.)</i> Locomotor ataxy.</p>
			<p>ZOE: <i>(Gaily.)</i> O, my dictionary.</p>
			<p>LYNCH: Three wise virgins.</p>
			<p>VIRAG: <i>(Agueshaken, profuse yellow spawn foaming over his bony epileptic lips.)</i> She sold lovephiltres, whitewax, orangeflower. Panther, the Roman centurion, polluted her with his genitories. <i>(He sticks out a flickering phosphorescent scorpion tongue, his hand on his fork.)</i> Messiah! He burst her tympanum. <i>(With gibbering baboon’s cries he jerks his hips in the cynical spasm.)</i> Hik! Hek! Hak! Hok! Huk! Kok! Kuk!</p>
			<p><i>(Ben Jumbo Dollard, rubicund, musclebound, hairynostrilled, hugebearded, cabbageeared, shaggychested, shockmaned, fatpapped, stands forth, his loins and genitals tightened into a pair of black bathing bagslops.)</i></p>
			<p>BEN DOLLARD: <i>(Nakkering castanet bones in his huge padded paws, yodels jovially in base barreltone.)</i> When love absorbs my ardent soul.</p>
			<p><i>(The virgins Nurse Callan and Nurse Quigley burst through the ringkeepers and the ropes and mob him with open arms.)</i></p>
			<p>THE VIRGINS: <i>(Gushingly.)</i> Big Ben! Ben my Chree!</p>
			<p>A VOICE: Hold that fellow with the bad breeches.</p>
			<p>BEN DOLLARD: <i>(Smites his thigh in abundant laughter.)</i> Hold him now.</p>
			<p>HENRY: <i>(Caressing on his breast a severed female head, murmurs.)</i> Thine heart, mine love. <i>(He plucks his lutestrings.)</i> When first I saw...</p>
			<p>VIRAG: <i>(Sloughing his skins, his multitudinous plumage moulting.)</i> Rats! <i>(He yawns, showing a coalblack throat, and closes his jaws by an upward push of his parchmentroll.)</i> After having said which I took my departure. Farewell. Fare thee well. <i>Dreck!</i></p>
			<p><i>(Henry Flower combs his moustache and beard rapidly with a pocketcomb and gives a cow’s lick to his hair. Steered by his rapier, he glides to the door, his wild harp slung behind him. Virag reaches the door in two ungainly stilthops, his tail cocked, and deftly claps sideways on the wall a pusyellow flybill, butting it with his head.)</i></p>
			<p>THE FLYBILL: K. 11. Post No Bills. Strictly confidential. Dr Hy Franks.</p>
			<p>HENRY: All is lost now.</p>
			<p><i>(Virag unscrews his head in a trice and holds it under his arm.)</i></p>
			<p>VIRAG’S HEAD: Quack!</p>
			<p><i>(Exeunt severally.)</i></p>
			<p>STEPHEN: <i>(Over his shoulder to Zoe.)</i> You would have preferred the fighting parson who founded the protestant error. But beware Antisthenes, the dog sage, and the last end of Arius Heresiarchus. The agony in the closet.</p>
			<p>LYNCH: All one and the same God to her.</p>
			<p>STEPHEN: <i>(Devoutly.)</i> And sovereign Lord of all things.</p>
			<p>FLORRY: <i>(To Stephen.)</i> I’m sure you’re a spoiled priest. Or a monk.</p>
			<p>LYNCH: He is. A cardinal’s son.</p>
			<p>STEPHEN: Cardinal sin. Monks of the screw.</p>
			<p><i>(His Eminence Simon Stephen Cardinal Dedalus, Primate of all Ireland, appears in the doorway, dressed in red soutane, sandals and socks. Seven dwarf simian acolytes, also in red, cardinal sins, uphold his train, peeping under it. He wears a battered silk hat sideways on his head. His thumbs are stuck in his armpits and his palms outspread. Round his neck hangs a rosary of corks ending on his breast in a corkscrew cross. Releasing his thumbs, he invokes grace from on high with large wave gestures and proclaims with bloated pomp:)</i></p>

			<p>THE DOORHANDLE: Theeee!</p>
			<p>ZOE: The devil is in that door.</p>
			<p><i>(A male form passes down the creaking staircase and is heard taking the waterproof and hat from the rack. Bloom starts forward involuntarily and, half closing the door as he passes, takes the chocolate from his pocket and offers it nervously to Zoe.)</i></p>
			<p>ZOE: <i>(Sniffs his hair briskly.)</i> Hmmm! Thank your mother for the rabbits. I’m very fond of what I like.</p>
			<p>BLOOM: <i>(Hearing a male voice in talk with the whores on the doorstep, pricks his ears.)</i> If it were he? After? Or because not? Or the double event?</p>
			<p>ZOE: <i>(Tears open the silverfoil.)</i> Fingers was made before forks. <i>(She breaks off and nibbles a piece, gives a piece to Kitty Ricketts and then turns kittenishly to Lynch.)</i> No objection to French lozenges? <i>(He nods. She taunts him.)</i> Have it now or wait till you get it? <i>(He opens his mouth, his head cocked. She whirls the prize in left circle. His head follows. She whirls it back in right circle. He eyes her.)</i> Catch!</p>
			<p><i>(She tosses a piece. With an adroit snap he catches it and bites it through with a crack.)</i></p>
			<p>KITTY: <i>(Chewing.)</i> The engineer I was with at the bazaar does have lovely ones. Full of the best liqueurs. And the viceroy was there with his lady. The gas we had on the Toft’s hobbyhorses. I’m giddy still.</p>
			<p>BLOOM: <i>(In Svengali’s fur overcoat, with folded arms and Napoleonic forelock, frowns in ventriloquial exorcism with piercing eagle glance towards the door. Then rigid with left foot advanced he makes a swift pass with impelling fingers and gives the sign of past master, drawing his right arm downwards from his left shoulder.)</i> Go, go, go, I conjure you, whoever you are!</p>
			<p><i>(A male cough and tread are heard passing through the mist outside. Bloom’s features relax. He places a hand in his waistcoat, posing calmly. Zoe offers him chocolate.)</i></p>
			<p>BLOOM: <i>(Solemnly.)</i> Thanks.</p>
			<p>ZOE: Do as you’re bid. Here!</p>
			<p><i>(A firm heelclacking tread is heard on the stairs.)</i></p>
			<p>BLOOM: <i>(Takes the chocolate.)</i> Aphrodisiac? Tansy and pennyroyal. But I bought it. Vanilla calms or? Mnemo. Confused light confuses memory. Red influences lupus. Colours affect women’s characters, any they have. This black makes me sad. Eat and be merry for tomorrow. <i>(He eats.)</i> Influence taste too, mauve. But it is so long since I. Seems new. Aphro. That priest. Must come. Better late than never. Try truffles at Andrews.</p>
			<p><i>(The door opens. Bella Cohen, a massive whoremistress, enters. She is dressed in a threequarter ivory gown, fringed round the hem with tasselled selvedge, and cools herself flirting a black horn fan like Minnie Hauck in</i> Carmen. <i>On her left hand are wedding and keeper rings. Her eyes are deeply carboned. She has a sprouting moustache. Her olive face is heavy, slightly sweated and fullnosed with orangetainted nostrils. She has large pendant beryl eardrops.)</i></p>
			<p>BELLA: My word! I’m all of a mucksweat.</p>
			<p><i>(She glances round her at the couples. Then her eyes rest on Bloom with hard insistence. Her large fan winnows wind towards her heated faceneck and embonpoint. Her falcon eyes glitter.)</i></p>
			<p>THE FAN: <i>(Flirting quickly, then slowly.)</i> Married, I see.</p>
			<p>BLOOM: Yes. Partly, I have mislaid...</p>
			<p>THE FAN: <i>(Half opening, then closing.)</i> And the missus is master. Petticoat government.</p>
			<p>BLOOM: <i>(Looks down with a sheepish grin.)</i> That is so.</p>
			<p>THE FAN: <i>(Folding together, rests against her left eardrop.)</i> Have you forgotten me?</p>
			<p>BLOOM: Nes. Yo.</p>
			<p>THE FAN: <i>(Folded akimbo against her waist.)</i> Is me her was you dreamed before? Was then she him you us since knew? Am all them and the same now we?</p>
			<p><i>(Bella approaches, gently tapping with the fan.)</i></p>
			<p>BLOOM: <i>(Wincing.)</i> Powerful being. In my eyes read that slumber which women love.</p>
			<p>THE FAN: <i>(Tapping.)</i> We have met. You are mine. It is fate.</p>
			<p>BLOOM: <i>(Cowed.)</i> Exuberant female. Enormously I desiderate your domination. I am exhausted, abandoned, no more young. I stand, so to speak, with an unposted letter bearing the extra regulation fee before the too late box of the general postoffice of human life. The door and window open at a right angle cause a draught of thirtytwo feet per second according to the law of falling bodies. I have felt this instant a twinge of sciatica in my left glutear muscle. It runs in our family. Poor dear papa, a widower, was a regular barometer from it. He believed in animal heat. A skin of tabby lined his winter waistcoat. Near the end, remembering king David and the Sunamite, he shared his bed with Athos, faithful after death. A dog’s spittle as you probably... <i>(He winces.)</i> Ah!</p>
			<p>RICHIE GOULDING: <i>(Bagweighted, passes the door.)</i> Mocking is catch. Best value in Dub. Fit for a prince’s. Liver and kidney.</p>
			<p>THE FAN: <i>(Tapping.)</i> All things end. Be mine. Now.</p>
			<p>BLOOM: <i>(Undecided.)</i> All now? I should not have parted with my talisman. Rain, exposure at dewfall on the searocks, a peccadillo at my time of life. Every phenomenon has a natural cause.</p>
			<p>THE FAN: <i>(Points downwards slowly.)</i> You may.</p>
			<p>BLOOM: <i>(Looks downwards and perceives her unfastened bootlace.)</i> We are observed.</p>
			<p>THE FAN: <i>(Points downwards quickly.)</i> You must.</p>
			<p>BLOOM: <i>(With desire, with reluctance.)</i> I can make a true black knot. Learned when I served my time and worked the mail order line for Kellett’s. Experienced hand. Every knot says a lot. Let me. In courtesy. I knelt once before today. Ah!</p>
			<p><i>(Bella raises her gown slightly and, steadying her pose, lifts to the edge of a chair a plump buskined hoof and a full pastern, silksocked. Bloom, stifflegged, aging, bends over her hoof and with gentle fingers draws out and in her laces.)</i></p>
			<p>BLOOM: <i>(Murmurs lovingly.)</i> To be a shoefitter in Manfield’s was my love’s young dream, the darling joys of sweet buttonhooking, to lace up crisscrossed to kneelength the dressy kid footwear satinlined, so incredibly impossibly small, of Clyde Road ladies. Even their wax model Raymonde I visited daily to admire her cobweb hose and stick of rhubarb toe, as worn in Paris.</p>
			<p>THE HOOF: Smell my hot goathide. Feel my royal weight.</p>
			<p>BLOOM: <i>(Crosslacing.)</i> Too tight?</p>
			<p>THE HOOF: If you bungle, Handy Andy, I’ll kick your football for you.</p>
			<p>BLOOM: Not to lace the wrong eyelet as I did the night of the bazaar dance. Bad luck. Hook in wrong tache of her... person you mentioned. That night she met... Now!</p>
			<p><i>(He knots the lace. Bella places her foot on the floor. Bloom raises his head. Her heavy face, her eyes strike him in midbrow. His eyes grow dull, darker and pouched, his nose thickens.)</i></p>
			<p>BLOOM: <i>(Mumbles.)</i> Awaiting your further orders we remain, gentlemen,...</p>
			<p>BELLO: <i>(With a hard basilisk stare, in a baritone voice.)</i> Hound of dishonour!</p>
			<p>BLOOM: <i>(Infatuated.)</i> Empress!</p>
			<p>BELLO: <i>(His heavy cheekchops sagging.)</i> Adorer of the adulterous rump!</p>
			<p>BLOOM: <i>(Plaintively.)</i> Hugeness!</p>

			<p>BLOOM: <i>(With sinews semiflexed.)</i> Magmagnificence!</p>
			<p>BELLO: Down! <i>(He taps her on the shoulder with his fan.)</i> Incline feet forward! Slide left foot one pace back! You will fall. You are falling. On the hands down!</p>
			<p>BLOOM: <i>(Her eyes upturned in the sign of admiration, closing, yaps.)</i> Truffles!</p>
			<p><i>(With a piercing epileptic cry she sinks on all fours, grunting, snuffling, rooting at his feet: then lies, shamming dead, with eyes shut tight, trembling eyelids, bowed upon the ground in the attitude of most excellent master.)</i></p>
			<p>BELLO: <i>(With bobbed hair, purple gills, fat moustache rings round his shaven mouth, in mountaineer’s puttees, green silverbuttoned coat, sport skirt and alpine hat with moorcock’s feather, his hands stuck deep in his breeches pockets, places his heel on her neck and grinds it in.)</i> Footstool! Feel my entire weight. Bow, bondslave, before the throne of your despot’s glorious heels so glistening in their proud erectness.</p>

			<p>BELLO: <i>(Laughs loudly.)</i> Holy smoke! You little know what’s in store for you. I’m the Tartar to settle your little lot and break you in! I’ll bet Kentucky cocktails all round I shame it out of you, old son. Cheek me, I dare you. If you do tremble in anticipation of heel discipline to be inflicted in gym costume.</p>

			<p>ZOE: <i>(Widening her slip to screen her.)</i> She’s not here.</p>

			<p>FLORRY: <i>(Hiding her with her gown.)</i> She didn’t mean it, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr</abbr> Bello. She’ll be good, sir.</p>

Just a little heart to heart talk, sweety. <i>(Bloom puts out her timid head.)</i> There’s a good girly now. <i>(Bello grabs her hair violently and drags her forward.)</i> I only want to correct you for your own good on a soft safe spot. How’s that tender behind? O, ever so gently, pet. Begin to get ready.</p>
			<p>BLOOM: <i>(Fainting.)</i> Don’t tear my...</p>
			<p>BELLO: <i>(Savagely.)</i> The nosering, the pliers, the bastinado, the hanging hook, the knout I’ll make you kiss while the flutes play like the Nubian slave of old. You’re in for it this time! I’ll make you remember me for the balance of your natural life. <i>(His forehead veins swollen, his face congested.)</i> I shall sit on your ottoman saddleback every morning after my thumping good breakfast of Matterson’s fat hamrashers and a bottle of Guinness’s porter. <i>(He belches.)</i> And suck my thumping good Stock Exchange cigar while I read the <i>Licensed Victualler’s Gazette</i>. Very possibly I shall have you slaughtered and skewered in my stables and enjoy a slice of you with crisp crackling from the baking tin basted and baked like sucking pig with rice and lemon or currant sauce. It will hurt you. <i>(He twists her arm. Bloom squeals, turning turtle.)</i></p>
			<p>BLOOM: Don’t be cruel, nurse! Don’t!</p>
			<p>BELLO: <i>(Twisting.)</i> Another!</p>
			<p>BLOOM: <i>(Screams.)</i> O, it’s hell itself! Every nerve in my body aches like mad!</p>
			<p>BELLO: <i>(Shouts.)</i> Good, by the rumping jumping general! That’s the best bit of news I heard these six weeks. Here, don’t keep me waiting, damn you! <i>(He slaps her face.)</i></p>

In five public conveniences he wrote pencilled messages offering his nuptial partner to all strongmembered males. And by the offensively smelling vitriol works did he not pass night after night by loving courting couples to see if and what and how much he could see? Did he not lie in bed, the gross boar, gloating over a nauseous fragment of wellused toilet paper presented to him by a nasty harlot, stimulated by gingerbread and a postal order?</p>

			<p>BELLO: <i>(Satirically.)</i> By day you will souse and bat our smelling underclothes also when we ladies are unwell, and swab out our latrines with dress pinned up and a dishclout tied to your tail. Won’t that be nice? <i>(He places a ruby ring on her finger.)</i> And there now! With this ring I thee own. Say, thank you, mistress.</p>
			<p>BLOOM: Thank you, mistress.</p>
			<p>BELLO: You will make the beds, get my tub ready, empty the pisspots in the different rooms, including old <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs</abbr> Keogh’s the cook’s, a sandy one. Ay, and rinse the seven of them well, mind, or lap it up like champagne. Drink me piping hot. Hop!

You’ll be taught the error of your ways. At night your wellcreamed braceletted hands will wear fortythreebutton gloves newpowdered with talc and having delicately scented fingertips. For such favours knights of old laid down their lives. <i>(He chuckles.)</i> My boys will be no end charmed to see you so ladylike, the colonel, above all, when they come here the night before the wedding to fondle my new attraction in gilded heels. First I’ll have a go at you myself. A man I know on the turf named Charles Alberta Marsh (I was in bed with him just now and another gentleman out of the Hanaper and Petty Bag office) is on the lookout for a maid of all work at a short knock. Swell the bust. Smile. Droop shoulders. What offers? <i>(He points.)</i> For that lot. Trained by owner to fetch and carry, basket in mouth. <i>(He bares his arm and plunges it elbowdeep in Bloom’s vulva.)</i> There’s fine depth for you! What, boys?

This downy skin, these soft muscles, this tender flesh. If I had only my gold piercer here! And quite easy to milk. Three newlaid gallons a day. A pure stockgetter, due to lay within the hour. His sire’s milk record was a thousand gallons of whole milk in forty weeks. Whoa, my jewel! Beg up! Whoa! <i>(He brands his initial C on Bloom’s croup.)</i> So! Warranted Cohen!

			<p>VOICES: <i>(Subdued.)</i> For the Caliph. Haroun Al Raschid.</p>
			<p>BELLO: <i>(Gaily.)</i> Right. Let them all come. The scanty, daringly short skirt, riding up at the knee to show a peep of white pantalette, is a potent weapon and transparent stockings, emeraldgartered, with the long straight seam trailing up beyond the knee, appeal to the better instincts of the <i>blasé</i> man about town. Learn the smooth mincing walk on four inch Louis Quinze heels, the Grecian bend with provoking croup, the thighs fluescent, knees modestly kissing. Bring all your powers of fascination to bear on them. Pander to their Gomorrahan vices.</p>
			<p>BLOOM: <i>(Bends his blushing face into his armpit and simpers with forefinger in mouth.)</i> O, I know what you’re hinting at now!</p>
			<p>BELLO: What else are you good for, an impotent thing like you? <i>(He stoops and, peering, pokes with his fan rudely under the fat suet folds of Bloom’s haunches.)</i> Up! Up! Manx cat!

He is something like a fullgrown outdoor man. Well for you, you muff, if you had that weapon with knobs and lumps and warts all over it. He shot his bolt, I can tell you! Foot to foot, knee to knee, belly to belly, bubs to breast! He’s no eunuch. A shock of red hair he has sticking out of him behind like a furzebush! Wait for nine months, my lad! Holy ginger, it’s kicking and coughing up and down in her guts already! That makes you wild, don’t it? Touches the spot? <i>(He spits in contempt.)</i> Spittoon!</p>

			<p>BELLO: Changed, eh? Our whatnot, our writingtable where we never wrote, aunt Hegarty’s armchair, our classic reprints of old masters. A man and his menfriends are living there in clover. The <i>Cuckoos’ Rest!</i> Why not? How many women had you, eh, following them up dark streets, flatfoot, exciting them by your smothered grunts, what, you male prostitute? Blameless dames with parcels of groceries. Turn about. Sauce for the goose, my gander O.</p>
			<p>BLOOM: They... I...</p>
			<p>BELLO: <i>(Cuttingly.)</i> Their heelmarks will stamp the Brusselette carpet you bought at Wren’s auction. In their horseplay with Moll the romp to find the buck flea in her breeches they will deface the little statue you carried home in the rain for art for art’s sake. They will violate the secrets of your bottom drawer. Pages will be torn from your handbook of astronomy to make them pipespills. And they will spit in your ten shilling brass fender from Hampton Leedom’s.</p>

			<p>BELLO: Die and be damned to you if you have any sense of decency or grace about you. I can give you a rare old wine that’ll send you skipping to hell and back. Sign a will and leave us any coin you have! If you have none see you damn well get it, steal it, rob it! We’ll bury you in our shrubbery jakes where you’ll be dead and dirty with old Cuck Cohen, my stepnephew I married, the bloody old gouty procurator and sodomite with a crick in his neck, and my other ten or eleven husbands, whatever the buggers’ names were, suffocated in the one cesspool. <i>(He explodes in a loud phlegmy laugh.)</i> We’ll manure you, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr</abbr> Flower! <i>(He pipes scoffingly.)</i> Byby, Poldy!

			<p>THE NYMPH: Mortal! You found me in evil company, highkickers, coster picnicmakers, pugilists, popular generals, immoral panto boys in fleshtights and the nifty shimmy dancers, La Aurora and Karini, musical act, the hit of the century. I was hidden in cheap pink paper that smelt of rock oil. I was surrounded by the stale smut of clubmen, stories to disturb callow youth, ads for transparencies, truedup dice and bustpads, proprietary articles and why wear a truss with testimonial from ruptured gentleman. Useful hints to the married.</p>
			<p>BLOOM: <i>(Lifts a turtle head towards her lap.)</i> We have met before. On another star.</p>
			<p>THE NYMPH: <i>(Sadly.)</i> Rubber goods. Neverrip brand as supplied to the aristocracy. Corsets for men. I cure fits or money refunded. Unsolicited testimonials for Professor Waldmann’s wonderful chest exuber.

			<p>BLOOM: You mean <i>Photo Bits?</i></p>
			<p>THE NYMPH: I do. You bore me away, framed me in oak and tinsel, set me above your marriage couch. Unseen, one summer eve, you kissed me in four places. And with loving pencil you shaded my eyes, my bosom and my shame.</p>
			<p>BLOOM: <i>(Humbly kisses her long hair.)</i> Your classic curves, beautiful immortal, I was glad to look on you, to praise you, a thing of beauty, almost to pray.</p>
			<p>THE NYMPH: During dark nights I heard your praise.</p>
			<p>BLOOM: <i>(Quickly.)</i> Yes, yes. You mean that I... Sleep reveals the worst side of everyone, children perhaps excepted. I know I fell out of bed or rather was pushed. Steel wine is said to cure snoring. For the rest there is that English invention, pamphlet of which I received some days ago, incorrectly addressed. It claims to afford a noiseless, inoffensive vent. <i>(He sighs.)</i> ’Twas ever thus. Frailty, thy name is marriage.</p>
			<p>THE NYMPH: <i>(Her fingers in her ears.)</i> And words. They are not in my dictionary.</p>
			<p>BLOOM: You understood them?</p>
			<p>THE YEWS: Ssh!</p>
			<p>THE NYMPH: <i>(Covers her face with her hands.)</i> What have I not seen in that chamber? What must my eyes look down on?</p>
			<p>BLOOM: <i>(Apologetically.)</i> I know. Soiled personal linen, wrong side up with care. The quoits are loose. From Gibraltar by long sea long ago.</p>
			<p>THE NYMPH: <i>(Bends her head.)</i> Worse, worse!</p>
			<p>BLOOM: <i>(Reflects precautiously.)</i> That antiquated commode. It wasn’t her weight. She scaled just eleven stone nine. She put on nine pounds after weaning. It was a crack and want of glue. Eh? And that absurd orangekeyed utensil which has only one handle.</p>

			<p><i>(Casqued halberdiers in armour thrust forward a pentice of gutted spearpoints.

			<p>VOICES: Police!</p>
			<p>DISTANT VOICES: Dublin’s burning! Dublin’s burning! On fire, on fire!</p>
			<p><i>(Brimstone fires spring up. Dense clouds roll past. Heavy Gatling guns boom. Pandemonium. Troops deploy. Gallop of hoofs. Artillery. Hoarse commands. Bells clang. Backers shout. Drunkards bawl. Whores screech. Foghorns hoot. Cries of valour. Shrieks of dying. Pikes clash on cuirasses. Thieves rob the slain. Birds of prey, winging from the sea, rising from marshlands, swooping from eyries, hover screaming, gannets, cormorants, vultures, goshawks, climbing woodcocks, peregrines, merlins, blackgrouse, sea eagles, gulls, albatrosses, barnacle geese. The midnight sun is darkened. The earth trembles. The dead of Dublin from Prospect and Mount Jerome in white sheepskin overcoats and black goatfell cloaks arise and appear to many. A chasm opens with a noiseless yawn. Tom Rochford, winner, in athlete’s singlet and breeches, arrives at the head of the national hurdle handicap and leaps into the void. He is followed by a race of runners and leapers. In wild attitudes they spring from the brink. Their bodies plunge. Factory lasses with fancy clothes toss redhot Yorkshire baraabombs. Society ladies lift their skirts above their heads to protect themselves. Laughing witches in red cutty sarks ride through the air on broomsticks. Quakerlyster plasters blisters. It rains dragons’ teeth. Armed heroes spring up from furrows. They exchange in amity the pass of knights of the red cross and fight duels with cavalry sabres: Wolfe Tone against Henry Grattan, Smith O’Brien against Daniel O’Connell, Michael Davitt against Isaac Butt, Justin M’Carthy against Parnell, Arthur Griffith against John Redmond, John O’Leary against Lear O’Johnny, Lord Edward Fitzgerald against Lord Gerald Fitzedward, The O’Donoghue of the Glens against The Glens of The O’Donoghue. On an eminence, the centre of the earth, rises the fieldaltar of Saint Barbara. Black candles rise from its gospel and epistle horns. From the high barbacans of the tower two shafts of light fall on the smokepalled altarstone. On the altarstone <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs</abbr> Mina Purefoy, goddess of unreason, lies, naked, fettered, a chalice resting on her swollen belly. Father Malachi O’Flynn in a lace petticoat and reversed chasuble, his two left feet back to the front, celebrates camp mass. The Reverend <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr</abbr> Hugh C Haines Love M.

			<p>BLOOM: <i>(Runs to Lynch.)</i> Can’t you get him away?</p>
			<p>LYNCH: He likes dialectic, the universal language. Kitty! <i>(To Bloom.)</i> Get him away, you. He won’t listen to me.</p>

			<p>STEPHEN: Stick, no. Reason. This feast of pure reason.</p>
			<p>CISSY CAFFREY: <i>(Pulling Private Carr.)</i> Come on, you’re boosed. He insulted me but I forgive him. <i>(Shouting in his ear.)</i> I forgive him for insulting me.</p>
			<p>BLOOM: <i>(Over Stephen’s shoulder.)</i> Yes, go. You see he’s incapable.</p>
			<p>PRIVATE CARR: <i>(Breaks loose.)</i> I’ll insult him.</p>
			<p><i>(He rushes towards Stephen, fist outstretched, and strikes him in the face. Stephen totters, collapses, falls, stunned. He lies prone, his face to the sky, his hat rolling to the wall. Bloom follows and picks it up.)</i></p>

			<p>A HAG: What call had the redcoat to strike the gentleman and he under the influence. Let them go and fight the Boers!</p>
			<p>THE BAWD: Listen to who’s talking! Hasn’t the soldier a right to go with his girl? He gave him the coward’s blow.</p>

			<p>FIRST WATCH: What’s wrong here?</p>
			<p>PRIVATE COMPTON: We were with this lady. And he insulted us. And assaulted my chum. <i>(The retriever barks.)</i> Who owns the bleeding tyke?</p>
			<p>CISSY CAFFREY: <i>(With expectation.)</i> Is he bleeding!</p>
			<p>A MAN: <i>(Rising from his knees.)</i> No. Gone off. He’ll come to all right.</p>
			<p>BLOOM: <i>(Glances sharply at the man.)</i> Leave him to me. I can easily...</p>
			<p>SECOND WATCH: Who are you? Do you know him?</p>
			<p>PRIVATE CARR: <i>(Lurches towards the watch.)</i> He insulted my lady friend.</p>
			<p>BLOOM: <i>(Angrily.)</i> You hit him without provocation. I’m a witness. Constable, take his regimental number.</p>
			<p>SECOND WATCH: I don’t want your instructions in the discharge of my duty.</p>
			<p>PRIVATE COMPTON: <i>(Pulling his comrade.)</i> Here, bugger off Harry. Or Bennett’ll shove you in the lockup.</p>
			<p>PRIVATE CARR: <i>(Staggering as he is pulled away.)</i> God fuck old Bennett. He’s a whitearsed bugger. I don’t give a shit for him.</p>
			<p>FIRST WATCH: <i>(Takes out his notebook.)</i> What’s his name?</p>
			<p>BLOOM: <i>(Peering over the crowd.)</i> I just see a car there. If you give me a hand a second, sergeant...</p>
			<p>FIRST WATCH: Name and address.</p>
			<p><i>(Corny Kelleher, weepers round his hat, a death wreath in his hand, appears among the bystanders.)</i></p>
			<p>BLOOM: <i>(Quickly.)</i> O, the very man! <i>(He whispers.)</i> Simon Dedalus’ son. A bit sprung. Get those policemen to move those loafers back.</p>
			<p>SECOND WATCH: Night, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr</abbr> Kelleher.</p>
			<p>CORNY KELLEHER: <i>(To the watch, with drawling eye.)</i> That’s all right. I know him. Won a bit on the races. Gold cup. Throwaway. <i>(He laughs.)</i> Twenty to one. Do you follow me?</p>
			<p>FIRST WATCH: <i>(Turns to the crowd.)</i> Here, what are you all gaping at? Move on out of that.</p>
			<p><i>(The crowd disperses slowly, muttering, down the lane.)</i></p>
			<p>CORNY KELLEHER: Leave it to me, sergeant. That’ll be all right. <i>(He laughs, shaking his head.)</i> We were often as bad ourselves, ay or worse. What? Eh, what?</p>
			<p>FIRST WATCH: <i>(Laughs.)</i> I suppose so.</p>
			<p>CORNY KELLEHER: <i>(Nudges the second watch.)</i> Come and wipe your name off the slate. <i>(He lilts, wagging his head.)</i> With my tooraloom tooraloom tooraloom tooraloom. What, eh, do you follow me?</p>
			<p>SECOND WATCH: <i>(Genially.)</i> Ah, sure we were too.</p>

			<p>BLOOM: <i>(Shakes hands with both of the watch in turn.)</i> Thank you very much, gentlemen. Thank you. <i>(He mumbles confidentially.)</i> We don’t want any scandal, you understand. Father is a wellknown highly respected citizen. Just a little wild oats, you understand.</p>
			<p>FIRST WATCH: O. I understand, sir.</p>
			<p>SECOND WATCH: That’s all right, sir.</p>
			<p>FIRST WATCH: It was only in case of corporal injuries I’d have to report it at the station.</p>
			<p>BLOOM: <i>(Nods rapidly.)</i> Naturally. Quite right. Only your bounden duty.</p>
			<p>SECOND WATCH: It’s our duty.</p>
			<p>CORNY KELLEHER: Good night, men.</p>
			<p>THE WATCH: <i>(Saluting together.)</i> Night, gentlemen. <i>(They move off with slow heavy tread.)</i></p>
			<p>BLOOM: <i>(Blows.)</i> Providential you came on the scene. You have a car?...</p>
			<p>CORNY KELLEHER: <i>(Laughs, pointing his thumb over his right shoulder to the car brought up against the scaffolding.)</i> Two commercials that were standing fizz in Jammet’s. Like princes, faith. One of them lost two quid on the race. Drowning his grief. And were on for a go with the jolly girls. So I landed them up on Behan’s car and down to nighttown.</p>
			<p>BLOOM: I was just going home by Gardiner street when I happened to...</p>
			<p>CORNY KELLEHER: <i>(Laughs.)</i> Sure they wanted me to join in with the mots. No, by God, says I. Not for old stagers like myself and yourself. <i>(He laughs again and leers with lacklustre eye.)</i> Thanks be to God we have it in the house, what, eh, do you follow me? Hah, hah, hah!</p>
			<p>BLOOM: <i>(Tries to laugh.)</i> He, he, he! Yes. Matter of fact I was just visiting an old friend of mine there, Virag, you don’t know him (poor fellow, he’s laid up for the past week) and we had a liquor together and I was just making my way home...</p>
			<p><i>(The horse neighs.)</i></p>
			<p>THE HORSE: Hohohohohohoh! Hohohohome!</p>
			<p>CORNY KELLEHER: Sure it was Behan our jarvey there that told me after we left the two commercials in <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs</abbr> Cohen’s and I told him to pull up and got off to see. <i>(He laughs.)</i> Sober hearsedrivers a speciality. Will I give him a lift home? Where does he hang out? Somewhere in Cabra, what?</p>
			<p>BLOOM: No, in Sandycove, I believe, from what he let drop.</p>
			<p><i>(Stephen, prone, breathes to the stars. Corny Kelleher, asquint, drawls at the horse. Bloom, in gloom, looms down.)</i></p>
			<p>CORNY KELLEHER: <i>(Scratches his nape.)</i> Sandycove! <i>(He bends down and calls to Stephen.)</i> Eh! <i>(He calls again.)</i> Eh! He’s covered with shavings anyhow. Take care they didn’t lift anything off him.</p>
			<p>BLOOM: No, no, no. I have his money and his hat here and stick.</p>
			<p>CORNY KELLEHER: Ah, well, he’ll get over it. No bones broken. Well, I’ll shove along. <i>(He laughs.)</i> I’ve a rendezvous in the morning. Burying the dead. Safe home!</p>
			<p>THE HORSE: <i>(Neighs.)</i> Hohohohohome.</p>
			<p>BLOOM: Good night. I’ll just wait and take him along in a few...</p>
			<p><i>(Corny Kelleher returns to the outside car and mounts it. The horse harness jingles.)</i></p>
			<p>CORNY KELLEHER: <i>(From the car, standing.)</i> Night.</p>
			<p>BLOOM: Night.</p>
			<p><i>(The jarvey chucks the reins and raises his whip encouragingly. The car and horse back slowly, awkwardly, and turn. Corny Kelleher on the sideseat sways his head to and fro in sign of mirth at Bloom’s plight. The jarvey joins in the mute pantomimic merriment nodding from the farther seat. Bloom shakes his head in mute mirthful reply. With thumb and palm Corny Kelleher reassures that the two bobbies will allow the sleep to continue for what else is to be done. With a slow nod Bloom conveys his gratitude as that is exactly what Stephen needs. The car jingles tooraloom round the corner of the tooraloom lane. Corny Kelleher again reassuralooms with his hand. Bloom with his hand assuralooms Corny Kelleher that he is reassuraloomtay. The tinkling hoofs and jingling harness grow fainter with their tooralooloo looloo lay. Bloom, holding in his hand Stephen’s hat, festooned with shavings, and ashplant, stands irresolute. Then he bends to him and shakes him by the shoulder.)</i></p>
			<p>BLOOM: Eh! Ho! <i>(There is no answer; he bends again.)</i> <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr</abbr> Dedalus! <i>(There is no answer.)</i> The name if you call. Somnambulist. <i>(He bends again and, hesitating, brings his mouth near the face of the prostrate form.)</i> Stephen! <i>(There is no answer. He calls again.)</i> Stephen!</p>
			<p>STEPHEN: <i>(Groans.)</i> Who? Black panther. Vampire. <i>(He sighs and stretches himself, then murmurs thickly with prolonged vowels.)</i></p>

			</blockquote>
			<p><i>(He turns on his left side, sighing, doubling himself together.)</i></p>
			<p>BLOOM: Poetry. Well educated. Pity. <i>(He bends again and undoes the buttons of Stephen’s waistcoat.)</i> To breathe. <i>(He brushes the woodshavings from Stephen’s clothes with light hand and fingers.)</i> One pound seven. Not hurt anyhow. <i>(He listens.)</i> What?</p>

			<p><i>(He stretches out his arms, sighs again and curls his body. Bloom, holding the hat and ashplant, stands erect. A dog barks in the distance. Bloom tightens and loosens his grip on the ashplant. He looks down on Stephen’s face and form.)</i></p>
			<p>BLOOM: <i>(Communes with the night.)</i> Face reminds me of his poor mother. In the shady wood. The deep white breast. Ferguson, I think I caught. A girl. Some girl.

He reads from right to left inaudibly, smiling, kissing the page.)</i></p>
