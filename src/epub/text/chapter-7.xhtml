The hoarse Dublin United Tramway Company’s timekeeper bawled them off:</p>

            <p>Red Murray’s long shears sliced out the advertisement from the newspaper in four clean strokes. Scissors and paste.</p>

            <p>They watched the knees, legs, boots vanish. Neck.</p>
            <p>A telegram boy stepped in nimbly, threw an envelope on the counter and stepped off posthaste with a word:</p>

            </h4>
            <p><abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr</abbr> Bloom halted behind the foreman’s spare body, admiring a glossy crown.</p>
            <p>Strange he never saw his real country. Ireland my country. Member for College green. He boomed that workaday worker tack for all it was worth. It’s the ads and side features sell a weekly, not the stale news in the official gazette. Queen Anne is dead. Published by authority in the year one thousand and. Demesne situate in the townland of Rosenallis, barony of Tinnahinch. To all whom it may concern schedule pursuant to statute showing return of number of mules and jennets exported from Ballina. Nature notes. Cartoons. Phil Blake’s weekly Pat and Bull story. Uncle Toby’s page for tiny tots. Country bumpkin’s queries. Dear <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr</abbr> Editor, what is a good cure for flatulence? I’d like that part. Learn a lot teaching others. The personal note. M. A. P. Mainly all pictures. Shapely bathers on golden strand. World’s biggest balloon. Double marriage of sisters celebrated. Two bridegrooms laughing heartily at each other. Cuprani too, printer. More Irish than the Irish.</p>
            <p>The machines clanked in threefour time. Thump, thump, thump. Now if he got paralysed there and no-one knew how to stop them they’d clank on and on the same, print it over and over and up and back. Monkeydoodle the whole thing. Want a cool head.</p>
            <p>—Well, get it into the evening edition, councillor, Hynes said.</p>
            <p>Soon be calling him my lord mayor. Long John is backing him, they say.</p>
            <p>The foreman, without answering, scribbled press on a corner of the sheet and made a sign to a typesetter. He handed the sheet silently over the dirty glass screen.</p>
            <p>—Right: thanks, Hynes said moving off.</p>
            <p><abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr</abbr> Bloom stood in his way.</p>
            <p>—If you want to draw the cashier is just going to lunch, he said, pointing backward with his thumb.</p>
            <p>—Did you? Hynes asked.</p>
            <p>—Mm, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr</abbr> Bloom said. Look sharp and you’ll catch him.</p>
            <p>—Thanks, old man, Hynes said. I’ll tap him too.</p>
            <p>He hurried on eagerly towards the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.newspaper">Freeman’s Journal</i>.</p>

            <p>The foreman moved his pencil towards it.</p>
            <p>—But wait, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr</abbr> Bloom said. He wants it changed. Keyes, you see. He wants two keys at the top.</p>
            <p>Hell of a racket they make. He doesn’t hear it. Nannan. Iron nerves. Maybe he understands what I.</p>
            <p>The foreman turned round to hear patiently and, lifting an elbow, began to scratch slowly in the armpit of his alpaca jacket.</p>
            <p>—Like that, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr</abbr> Bloom said, crossing his forefingers at the top.</p>

            <p><abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr</abbr> Bloom, glancing sideways up from the cross he had made, saw the foreman’s sallow face, think he has a touch of jaundice, and beyond the obedient reels feeding in huge webs of paper. Clank it. Clank it. Miles of it unreeled. What becomes of it after? O, wrap up meat, parcels: various uses, thousand and one things.</p>
            <p>Slipping his words deftly into the pauses of the clanking he drew swiftly on the scarred woodwork.</p>

            <p>Better not teach him his own business.</p>
            <p>—You know yourself, councillor, just what he wants. Then round the top in leaded: the house of keys. You see? Do you think that’s a good idea?</p>
            <p>The foreman moved his scratching hand to his lower ribs and scratched there quietly.</p>
            <p>—The idea, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr</abbr> Bloom said, is the house of keys. You know, councillor, the Manx parliament. Innuendo of home rule. Tourists, you know, from the isle of Man. Catches the eye, you see. Can you do that?</p>
            <p>I could ask him perhaps about how to pronounce that <i xml:lang="it">voglio</i>. But then if he didn’t know only make it awkward for him. Better not.</p>
            <p>—We can do that, the foreman said. Have you the design?</p>
            <p>—I can get it, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr</abbr> Bloom said. It was in a Kilkenny paper. He has a house there too. I’ll just run out and ask him. Well, you can do that and just a little par calling attention. You know the usual. Highclass licensed premises. Longfelt want. So on.</p>
            <p>The foreman thought for an instant.</p>
            <p>—We can do that, he said. Let him give us a three months’ renewal.</p>
            <p>A typesetter brought him a limp galleypage. He began to check it silently. <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr</abbr> Bloom stood by, hearing the loud throbs of cranks, watching the silent typesetters at their cases.</p>

            <b>A DAYFATHER</b>
            </h4>
            <p>He walked on through the caseroom passing an old man, bowed, spectacled, aproned. Old Monks, the dayfather. Queer lot of stuff he must have put through his hands in his time: obituary notices, pubs’ ads, speeches, divorce suits, found drowned. Nearing the end of his tether now. Sober serious man with a bit in the savingsbank I’d say. Wife a good cook and washer. Daughter working the machine in the parlour. Plain Jane, no damn nonsense.</p>
            <h4 id="pgepubid00023">
            <b>AND IT WAS THE FEAST OF THE PASSOVER</b>
            </h4>
            <p>He stayed in his walk to watch a typesetter neatly distributing type. Reads it backwards first. Quickly he does it. Must require some practice that. mangiD kcirtaP. Poor papa with his hagadah book, reading backwards with his finger to me. Pessach. Next year in Jerusalem. Dear, O dear! All that long business about that brought us out of the land of Egypt and into the house of bondage <i xml:lang="he">alleluia. Shema Israel Adonai Elohenu</i>. No, that’s the other. Then the twelve brothers, Jacob’s sons. And then the lamb and the cat and the dog and the stick and the water and the butcher. And then the angel of death kills the butcher and he kills the ox and the dog kills the cat. Sounds a bit silly till you come to look into it well. Justice it means but it’s everybody eating everyone else. That’s what life is after all. How quickly he does that job. Practice makes perfect. Seems to see with his fingers.</p>
            <p><abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr</abbr> Bloom passed on out of the clanking noises through the gallery on to the landing. Now am I going to tram it out all the way and then catch him out perhaps. Better phone him up first. Number? Yes. Same as Citron’s house. Twentyeight. Twentyeight double four.</p>

            <p>He went down the house staircase. Who the deuce scrawled all over those walls with matches? Looks as if they did it for a bet. Heavy greasy smell there always is in those works. Lukewarm glue in Thom’s next door when I was there.</p>
            <p>He took out his handkerchief to dab his nose. Citronlemon? Ah, the soap I put there. Lose it out of that pocket. Putting back his handkerchief he took out the soap and stowed it away, buttoned, into the hip pocket of his trousers.</p>
            <p>What perfume does your wife use? I could go home still: tram: something I forgot. Just to see: before: dressing. No. Here. No.</p>
            <p>A sudden screech of laughter came from the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.newspaper">Evening Telegraph</i> office. Know who that is. What’s up? Pop in a minute to phone. Ned Lambert it is.</p>

What about that, Simon? he asked over the fringe of his newspaper. How’s that for high?</p>
            <p>—Changing his drink, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr</abbr> Dedalus said.</p>
            <p>Ned Lambert, laughing, struck the newspaper on his knees, repeating:</p>

            <p>He ate off the crescent of water biscuit he had been nibbling and, hungered, made ready to nibble the biscuit in his other hand.</p>
            <p>High falutin stuff. Bladderbags. Ned Lambert is taking a day off I see. Rather upsets a man’s day, a funeral does. He has influence they say. Old Chatterton, the vicechancellor, is his granduncle or his greatgranduncle. Close on ninety they say. Subleader for his death written this long time perhaps. Living to spite them. Might go first himself. Johnny, make room for your uncle. The right honourable Hedges Eyre Chatterton. Daresay he writes him an odd shaky cheque or two on gale days. Windfall when he kicks out. Alleluia.</p>

            <p>—Very much so, professor MacHugh said. To be seen and heard. He’s in his sanctum with Lenehan.</p>

            <p>Ned Lambert tossed the newspaper aside, chuckling with delight. An instant after a hoarse bark of laughter burst over professor MacHugh’s unshaven blackspectacled face.</p>

Get a grip of them by the stomach.</p>
            <p>The inner door was opened violently and a scarlet beaked face, crested by a comb of feathery hair, thrust itself in. The bold blue eyes stared about them and the harsh voice asked:</p>
            <p>—What is it?</p>
            <p>—And here comes the sham squire himself! professor MacHugh said grandly.</p>

            <p>He tossed the tissues on to the table.</p>
            <p>Screams of newsboys barefoot in the hall rushed near and the door was flung open.</p>
            <p>—Hush, Lenehan said. I hear feetstoops.</p>
            <p>Professor MacHugh strode across the room and seized the cringing urchin by the collar as the others scampered out of the hall and down the steps. The tissues rustled up in the draught, floated softly in the air blue scrawls and under the table came to earth.</p>
            <p>—It wasn’t me, sir. It was the big fellow shoved me, sir.</p>
            <p>—Throw him out and shut the door, the editor said. There’s a hurricane blowing.</p>
            <p>Lenehan began to paw the tissues up from the floor, grunting as he stooped twice.</p>
            <p>—Waiting for the racing special, sir, the newsboy said. It was Pat Farrell shoved me, sir.</p>

            <p>—<em>Pardon, monsieur</em>, Lenehan said, clutching him for an instant and making a grimace.</p>
            <p>—My fault, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr</abbr> Bloom said, suffering his grip. Are you hurt? I’m in a hurry.</p>

            <p>He went to the door and, holding it ajar, paused. J. J. O’Molloy slapped the heavy pages over. The noise of two shrill voices, a mouthorgan, echoed in the bare hallway from the newsboys squatted on the doorsteps:</p>

            <p>He looked indecisively for a moment at their faces. The editor who, leaning against the mantelshelf, had propped his head on his hand, suddenly stretched forth an arm amply.</p>
            <p>—Begone! he said. The world is before you.</p>
            <p>—Back in no time, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr</abbr> Bloom said, hurrying out.</p>
            <p>J. J. O’Molloy took the tissues from Lenehan’s hand and read them, blowing them apart gently, without comment.</p>
            <p>—He’ll get that advertisement, the professor said, staring through his blackrimmed spectacles over the crossblind. Look at the young scamps after him.</p>
            <p>—Show. Where? Lenehan cried, running to the window.</p>

            <p>He began to mazurka in swift caricature across the floor on sliding feet past the fireplace to J. J. O’Molloy who placed the tissues in his receiving hands.</p>
            <p>—What’s that? Myles Crawford said with a start. Where are the other two gone?</p>
            <p>—Who? the professor said, turning. They’re gone round to the Oval for a drink. Paddy Hooper is there with Jack Hall. Came over last night.</p>
            <p>—Come on then, Myles Crawford said. Where’s my hat?</p>
            <p>He walked jerkily into the office behind, parting the vent of his jacket, jingling his keys in his back pocket. They jingled then in the air and against the wood as he locked his desk drawer.</p>
            <p>—He’s pretty well on, professor MacHugh said in a low voice.</p>
            <p>—Seems to be, J. J. O’Molloy said, taking out a cigarettecase in murmuring meditation, but it is not always as it seems. Who has the most matches?</p>

            <p>The editor came from the inner office, a straw hat awry on his brow. He declaimed in song, pointing sternly at professor MacHugh:</p>
            <p class="poem"> ’Twas rank and fame that tempted thee,<br/> ’Twas empire charmed thy heart.</p>
            <p>The professor grinned, locking his long lips.</p>
            <p>—Eh? You bloody old Roman empire? Myles Crawford said.</p>
            <p>He took a cigarette from the open case. Lenehan, lighting it for him with quick grace, said:</p>
            <p>—Silence for my brandnew riddle!</p>
            <p>—<i xml:lang="la">Imperium romanum</i>, J. J. O’Molloy said gently. It sounds nobler than British or Brixton. The word reminds one somehow of fat in the fire.</p>
            <p>Myles Crawford blew his first puff violently towards the ceiling.</p>
            <p>—That’s it, he said. We are the fat. You and I are the fat in the fire. We haven’t got the chance of a snowball in hell.</p>

            <p>He extended elocutionary arms from frayed stained shirtcuffs, pausing:</p>
            <p>—What was their civilisation? Vast, I allow: but vile. Cloacae: sewers. The Jews in the wilderness and on the mountaintop said: <em>It is meet to be here. Let us build an altar to Jehovah</em>. The Roman, like the Englishman who follows in his footsteps, brought to every new shore on which he set his foot (on our shore he never set it) only his cloacal obsession. He gazed about him in his toga and he said: <em>It is meet to be here. Let us construct a watercloset.</em></p>
            <p>—Which they accordingly did do, Lenehan said. Our old ancient ancestors, as we read in the first chapter of Guinness’s, were partial to the running stream.</p>
            <p>—They were nature’s gentlemen, J. J. O’Molloy murmured. But we have also Roman law.</p>
            <p>—And Pontius Pilate is its prophet, professor MacHugh responded.</p>
            <p>—Do you know that story about chief baron Palles? J. J. O’Molloy asked. It was at the royal university dinner. Everything was going swimmingly ...</p>

            <p>The professor, returning by way of the files, swept his hand across Stephen’s and <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr</abbr> O’Madden Burke’s loose ties.</p>
            <p>—Paris, past and present, he said. You look like communards.</p>
            <p>—Like fellows who had blown up the Bastile, J. J. O’Molloy said in quiet mockery. Or was it you shot the lord lieutenant of Finland between you? You look as though you had done the deed. General Bobrikoff.</p>

            <p>The editor laid a nervous hand on Stephen’s shoulder.</p>
            <p>—I want you to write something for me, he said. Something with a bite in it. You can do it. I see it in your face. <em>In the lexicon of youth</em>...</p>

            <p>—You can do it, Myles Crawford repeated, clenching his hand in emphasis. Wait a minute. We’ll paralyse Europe as Ignatius Gallaher used to say when he was on the shaughraun, doing billiardmarking in the Clarence. Gallaher, that was a pressman for you. That was a pen. You know how he made his mark? I’ll tell you. That was the smartest piece of journalism ever known. That was in eightyone, sixth of May, time of the invincibles, murder in the Phoenix park, before you were born, I suppose. I’ll show you.</p>

            <p>—And poor Gumley is down there too, so he told me, minding stones for the corporation. A night watchman.</p>
            <p>Stephen turned in surprise.</p>
            <p>—Gumley? he said. You don’t say so? A friend of my father’s, is it?</p>
            <p>—Never mind Gumley, Myles Crawford cried angrily. Let Gumley mind the stones, see they don’t run away. Look at here. What did Ignatius Gallaher do? I’ll tell you. Inspiration of genius. Cabled right away. Have you <i epub:type="se:name.publication.newspaper">Weekly Freeman</i> of 17 March? Right. Have you got that?</p>
            <p>He flung back pages of the files and stuck his finger on a point.</p>

            <p>—Madam, I’m Adam. And Able was I ere I saw Elba.</p>
            <p>—History! Myles Crawford cried. The Old Woman of Prince’s street was there first. There was weeping and gnashing of teeth over that. Out of an advertisement. Gregor Grey made the design for it. That gave him the leg up. Then Paddy Hooper worked Tay Pay who took him on to the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.newspaper">Star</i>.

            <p>—O yes, J. J. O’Molloy said eagerly. Lady Dudley was walking home through the park to see all the trees that were blown down by that cyclone last year and thought she’d buy a view of Dublin. And it turned out to be a commemoration postcard of Joe Brady or Number One or Skin-the-Goat. Right outside the viceregal lodge, imagine!</p>
            <p>—They’re only in the hook and eye department, Myles Crawford said. Psha! Press and the bar! Where have you a man now at the bar like those fellows, like Whiteside, like Isaac Butt, like silvertongued O’Hagan. Eh? Ah, bloody nonsense. Psha! Only in the halfpenny place.</p>

            <p>—Grattan and Flood wrote for this very paper, the editor cried in his face. Irish volunteers. Where are you now? Established 1763. Dr Lucas. Who have you now like John Philpot Curran? Psha!</p>
            <p>—Well, J. J. O’Molloy said, Bushe K.C., for example.</p>
            <p>—Bushe? the editor said. Well, yes: Bushe, yes. He has a strain of it in his blood. Kendal Bushe or I mean Seymour Bushe.</p>

            <p>J. J. O’Molloy turned to Stephen and said quietly and slowly:</p>
            <p>—One of the most polished periods I think I ever listened to in my life fell from the lips of Seymour Bushe. It was in that case of fratricide, the Childs murder case. Bushe defended him.</p>

            <p>—He said of it: <em>that stony effigy in frozen music, horned and terrible, of the human form divine, that eternal symbol of wisdom and of prophecy which, if aught that the imagination or the hand of sculptor has wrought in marble of soultransfigured and of soultransfiguring deserves to live, deserves to live.</em></p>
            <p>His slim hand with a wave graced echo and fall.</p>

            <b>A MAN OF HIGH MORALE</b>
            </h4>
            <p>—Professor Magennis was speaking to me about you, J. J. O’Molloy said to Stephen. What do you think really of that hermetic crowd, the opal hush poets: A. E. the mastermystic? That Blavatsky woman started it. She was a nice old bag of tricks. A. E. has been telling some yankee interviewer that you came to him in the small hours of the morning to ask him about planes of consciousness. Magennis thinks you must have been pulling A. E.’s leg. He is a man of the very highest morale, Magennis.</p>
            <p>Speaking about me. What did he say? What did he say? What did he say about me? Don’t ask.</p>
            <p>—No, thanks, professor MacHugh said, waving the cigarettecase aside. Wait a moment. Let me say one thing. The finest display of oratory I ever heard was a speech made by John F Taylor at the college historical society. <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr</abbr> Justice Fitzgibbon, the present lord justice of appeal, had spoken and the paper under debate was an essay (new for those days), advocating the revival of the Irish tongue.</p>
            <p>He turned towards Myles Crawford and said:</p>
            <p>—You know Gerald Fitzgibbon. Then you can imagine the style of his discourse.</p>
            <p>—He is sitting with Tim Healy, J. J. O’Molloy said, rumour has it, on the Trinity college estates commission.</p>
            <p>—He is sitting with a sweet thing, Myles Crawford said, in a child’s frock. Go on. Well?</p>
            <p>—It was the speech, mark you, the professor said, of a finished orator, full of courteous haughtiness and pouring in chastened diction I will not say the vials of his wrath but pouring the proud man’s contumely upon the new movement. It was then a new movement. We were weak, therefore worthless.</p>
            <p>He closed his long thin lips an instant but, eager to be on, raised an outspanned hand to his spectacles and, with trembling thumb and ringfinger touching lightly the black rims, steadied them to a new focus.</p>
            <h4 id="pgepubid00054">
            <b>IMPROMPTU</b>
            </h4>
            <p>In ferial tone he addressed J. J. O’Molloy:</p>
            <p>—Taylor had come there, you must know, from a sickbed. That he had prepared his speech I do not believe for there was not even one shorthandwriter in the hall. His dark lean face had a growth of shaggy beard round it. He wore a loose white silk neckcloth and altogether he looked (though he was not) a dying man.</p>
            <p>His gaze turned at once but slowly from J. J. O’Molloy’s towards Stephen’s face and then bent at once to the ground, seeking. His unglazed linen collar appeared behind his bent head, soiled by his withering hair. Still seeking, he said:</p>
            <p>—When Fitzgibbon’s speech had ended John F Taylor rose to reply. Briefly, as well as I can bring them to mind, his words were these.</p>
            <p>He raised his head firmly. His eyes bethought themselves once more. Witless shellfish swam in the gross lenses to and fro, seeking outlet.</p>
            <p>He began:</p>
            <p><i>—<abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr</abbr> Chairman, ladies and gentlemen: Great was my admiration in listening to the remarks addressed to the youth of Ireland a moment since by my learned friend. It seemed to me that I had been transported into a country far away from this country, into an age remote from this age, that I stood in ancient Egypt and that I was listening to the speech of some highpriest of that land addressed to the youthful Moses.</i></p>
            <p>His listeners held their cigarettes poised to hear, their smokes ascending in frail stalks that flowered with his speech. <em>And let our crooked smokes.</em> Noble words coming. Look out. Could you try your hand at it yourself?</p>
            <p><em>—And it seemed to me that I heard the voice of that Egyptian highpriest raised in a tone of like haughtiness and like pride. I heard his words and their meaning was revealed to me.</em></p>
            <h4 id="pgepubid00055">
            <b>FROM THE FATHERS</b>
            </h4>
            <p>It was revealed to me that those things are good which yet are corrupted which neither if they were supremely good nor unless they were good could be corrupted. Ah, curse you! That’s saint Augustine.</p>
            <p><i>—Why will you jews not accept our culture, our religion and our language? You are a tribe of nomad herdsmen: we are a mighty people. You have no cities nor no wealth: our cities are hives of humanity and our galleys, trireme and quadrireme, laden with all manner merchandise furrow the waters of the known globe. You have but emerged from primitive conditions: we have a literature, a priesthood, an agelong history and a polity.</i></p>
            <p>Nile.</p>
            <p>Child, man, effigy.</p>
            <p>By the Nilebank the babemaries kneel, cradle of bulrushes: a man supple in combat: stonehorned, stonebearded, heart of stone.</p>
            <p><i>—You pray to a local and obscure idol: our temples, majestic and mysterious, are the abodes of Isis and Osiris, of Horus and Ammon Ra. Yours serfdom, awe and humbleness: ours thunder and the seas. Israel is weak and few are her children: Egypt is an host and terrible are her arms. Vagrants and daylabourers are you called: the world trembles at our name.</i></p>
            <p>A dumb belch of hunger cleft his speech. He lifted his voice above it boldly:</p>
            <p><i>—But, ladies and gentlemen, had the youthful Moses listened to and accepted that view of life, had he bowed his head and bowed his will and bowed his spirit before that arrogant admonition he would never have brought the chosen people out of their house of bondage, nor followed the pillar of the cloud by day. He would never have spoken with the Eternal amid lightnings on Sinai’s mountaintop nor ever have come down with the light of inspiration shining in his countenance and bearing in his arms the tables of the law, graven in the language of the outlaw.</i></p>
            <p>He ceased and looked at them, enjoying a silence.</p>

            <p>The troop of bare feet was heard rushing along the hallway and pattering up the staircase.</p>
            <p>—That is oratory, the professor said uncontradicted. </p>
            <p>Gone with the wind. Hosts at Mullaghmast and Tara of the kings. Miles of ears of porches. The tribune’s words, howled and scattered to the four winds.

            <p>I have money.</p>
            <p>—Gentlemen, Stephen said. As the next motion on the agenda paper may I suggest that the house do now adjourn?</p>
            <p>—You take my breath away. It is not perchance a French compliment? <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr</abbr> O’Madden Burke asked. ’Tis the hour, methinks, when the winejug, metaphorically speaking, is most grateful in Ye ancient hostelry.</p>

            <p>He went into the inner office, closing the door behind him.</p>
            <p>—Come along, Stephen, the professor said. That is fine, isn’t it? It has the prophetic vision. <i xml:lang="la">Fuit Ilium!</i> The sack of windy Troy. Kingdoms of this world. The masters of the Mediterranean are fellaheen today.</p>
            <p>The first newsboy came pattering down the stairs at their heels and rushed out into the street, yelling:</p>
            <p>—Racing special!</p>
            <p>Dublin. I have much, much to learn.</p>
            <p>They turned to the left along Abbey street.</p>
            <p>—I have a vision too, Stephen said.</p>
            <p>—Yes? the professor said, skipping to get into step. Crawford will follow.</p>
            <p>Another newsboy shot past them, yelling as he ran:</p>
            <p>—Racing special!</p>
            <h4 id="pgepubid00058">
            <b>DEAR DIRTY DUBLIN</b>
            </h4>
            <p>Dubliners.</p>
            <p>—Two Dublin vestals, Stephen said, elderly and pious, have lived fifty and fiftythree years in Fumbally’s lane.</p>
            <p>—Where is that? the professor asked.</p>
            <p>—Off Blackpitts, Stephen said.</p>
            <p>Damp night reeking of hungry dough. Against the wall. Face glistering tallow under her fustian shawl. Frantic hearts. Akasic records. Quicker, darlint!</p>
            <p>On now. Dare it. Let there be life.</p>
            <p>—They want to see the views of Dublin from the top of Nelson’s pillar. They save up three and tenpence in a red tin letterbox moneybox. They shake out the threepenny bits and sixpences and coax out the pennies with the blade of a knife. Two and three in silver and one and seven in coppers. They put on their bonnets and best clothes and take their umbrellas for fear it may come on to rain.</p>
            <p>—Wise virgins, professor MacHugh said.</p>
            <h4 id="pgepubid00059">
            <b>LIFE ON THE RAW</b>
            </h4>
            <p>—They buy one and fourpenceworth of brawn and four slices of panloaf at the north city diningrooms in Marlborough street from <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Miss</abbr> Kate Collins, proprietress... They purchase four and twenty ripe plums from a girl at the foot of Nelson’s pillar to take off the thirst of the brawn. They give two threepenny bits to the gentleman at the turnstile and begin to waddle slowly up the winding staircase, grunting, encouraging each other, afraid of the dark, panting, one asking the other have you the brawn, praising God and the Blessed Virgin, threatening to come down, peeping at the airslits. Glory be to God. They had no idea it was that high.</p>
            <p>Their names are Anne Kearns and Florence MacCabe. Anne Kearns has the lumbago for which she rubs on Lourdes water, given her by a lady who got a bottleful from a passionist father. Florence MacCabe takes a crubeen and a bottle of double X for supper every Saturday.</p>
            <p>—Antithesis, the professor said nodding twice. Vestal virgins. I can see them. What’s keeping our friend?</p>
            <p>He turned.</p>
            <p>A bevy of scampering newsboys rushed down the steps, scattering in all directions, yelling, their white papers fluttering. Hard after them Myles Crawford appeared on the steps, his hat aureoling his scarlet face, talking with J. J. O’Molloy.</p>
            <p>—Come along, the professor cried, waving his arm.</p>
            <p>He set off again to walk by Stephen’s side.</p>
            <h4 id="pgepubid00060">
            <b>RETURN OF BLOOM</b>
            </h4>
            <p>—Yes, he said. I see them.</p>
            <p><abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr</abbr> Bloom, breathless, caught in a whirl of wild newsboys near the offices of the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.newspaper">Irish Catholic</i> and <i epub:type="se:name.publication.newspaper">Dublin Penny Journal</i>, called:</p>
            <p>—<abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr</abbr> Crawford! A moment!</p>
            <p>—<i epub:type="se:name.publication.newspaper">Telegraph</i>! Racing special!</p>
            <p>—What is it? Myles Crawford said, falling back a pace.</p>
            <p>A newsboy cried in <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr</abbr> Bloom’s face:</p>
            <p>—Terrible tragedy in Rathmines! A child bit by a bellows!</p>
            <h4 id="pgepubid00061">
            <b>INTERVIEW WITH THE EDITOR</b>
            </h4>
            <p>—Just this ad, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr</abbr> Bloom said, pushing through towards the steps, puffing, and taking the cutting from his pocket. I spoke with <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr</abbr> Keyes just now. He’ll give a renewal for two months, he says. After he’ll see. But he wants a par to call attention in the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.newspaper">Telegraph</i> too, the Saturday pink. And he wants it copied if it’s not too late I told councillor Nannetti from the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.newspaper">Kilkenny People</i>. I can have access to it in the national library. House of keys, don’t you see? His name is Keyes. It’s a play on the name. But he practically promised he’d give the renewal. But he wants just a little puff. What will I tell him, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr</abbr> Crawford?</p>
            <h4 id="pgepubid00062">
            <b>K.M.A.</b>
            </h4>
            <p>—Will you tell him he can kiss my arse? Myles Crawford said throwing out his arm for emphasis. Tell him that straight from the stable.</p>
            <p>A bit nervy. Look out for squalls. All off for a drink. Arm in arm. Lenehan’s yachting cap on the cadge beyond. Usual blarney. Wonder is that young Dedalus the moving spirit. Has a good pair of boots on him today. Last time I saw him he had his heels on view. Been walking in muck somewhere. Careless chap. What was he doing in Irishtown?</p>
            <p>—Well, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr</abbr> Bloom said, his eyes returning, if I can get the design I suppose it’s worth a short par. He’d give the ad, I think. I’ll tell him...</p>
            <h4 id="pgepubid00063">
            <b>K.M.R.I.A.</b>
            </h4>
            <p>—He can kiss my royal Irish arse, Myles Crawford cried loudly over his shoulder. Any time he likes, tell him.</p>
            <p>While <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr</abbr> Bloom stood weighing the point and about to smile he strode on jerkily.</p>
            <h4 id="pgepubid00064">
            <b>RAISING THE WIND</b>
            </h4>
            <p>—<i xml:lang="la">Nulla bona</i>, Jack, he said, raising his hand to his chin. I’m up to here. I’ve been through the hoop myself. I was looking for a fellow to back a bill for me no later than last week. Sorry, Jack. You must take the will for the deed. With a heart and a half if I could raise the wind anyhow.</p>
            <p>J. J. O’Molloy pulled a long face and walked on silently. They caught up on the others and walked abreast.</p>
            <p>—When they have eaten the brawn and the bread and wiped their twenty fingers in the paper the bread was wrapped in they go nearer to the railings.</p>
            <p>—Something for you, the professor explained to Myles Crawford. Two old Dublin women on the top of Nelson’s pillar.</p>
            <h4 id="pgepubid00065">
            <b>SOME COLUMN!—THAT’S WHAT WADDLER ONE SAID</b>
            </h4>
            <p>—That’s new, Myles Crawford said. That’s copy. Out for the waxies’ Dargle. Two old trickies, what?</p>
            <p>—But they are afraid the pillar will fall, Stephen went on. They see the roofs and argue about where the different churches are: Rathmines’ blue dome, Adam and Eve’s, saint Laurence O’Toole’s. But it makes them giddy to look so they pull up their skirts...</p>
            <h4 id="pgepubid00066">
            <b>THOSE SLIGHTLY RAMBUNCTIOUS FEMALES</b>
            </h4>
            <p>—Easy all, Myles Crawford said. No poetic licence. We’re in the archdiocese here.</p>
            <p>—And settle down on their striped petticoats, peering up at the statue of the onehandled adulterer.</p>
            <p>—Onehandled adulterer! the professor cried. I like that. I see the idea. I see what you mean.</p>
            <h4 id="pgepubid00067">
            <b>DAMES DONATE DUBLIN’S CITS SPEEDPILLS VELOCITOUS AEROLITHS, BELIEF</b>
            </h4>
            <p>—It gives them a crick in their necks, Stephen said, and they are too tired to look up or down or to speak. They put the bag of plums between them and eat the plums out of it, one after another, wiping off with their handkerchiefs the plumjuice that dribbles out of their mouths and spitting the plumstones slowly out between the railings.</p>
            <p>He gave a sudden loud young laugh as a close. Lenehan and <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr</abbr> O’Madden Burke, hearing, turned, beckoned and led on across towards Mooney’s.</p>
            <p>—Finished? Myles Crawford said. So long as they do no worse.</p>
            <h4 id="pgepubid00068">
            <b>SOPHIST WALLOPS HAUGHTY HELEN SQUARE ON PROBOSCIS. SPARTANS GNASH MOLARS. ITHACANS VOW PEN IS CHAMP.</b>
            </h4>
            <p>—You remind me of Antisthenes, the professor said, a disciple of Gorgias, the sophist. It is said of him that none could tell if he were bitterer against others or against himself. He was the son of a noble and a bondwoman. And he wrote a book in which he took away the palm of beauty from Argive Helen and handed it to poor Penelope.</p>
            <p>Poor Penelope. Penelope Rich.</p>
            <p>They made ready to cross O’Connell street.</p>
            <h4 id="pgepubid00069">
            <b>HELLO THERE, CENTRAL!</b>
            </h4>
            <p>At various points along the eight lines tramcars with motionless trolleys stood in their tracks, bound for or from Rathmines, Rathfarnham, Blackrock, Kingstown and Dalkey, Sandymount Green, Ringsend and Sandymount Tower, Donnybrook, Palmerston Park and Upper Rathmines, all still, becalmed in short circuit. Hackney cars, cabs, delivery waggons, mailvans, private broughams, aerated mineral water floats with rattling crates of bottles, rattled, rolled, horsedrawn, rapidly.</p>
            <h4 id="pgepubid00070">
            <b>WHAT?—AND LIKEWISE—WHERE?</b>
            </h4>
            <p>—But what do you call it? Myles Crawford asked. Where did they get the plums?</p>
            <h4 id="pgepubid00071">
            <b>VIRGILIAN, SAYS PEDAGOGUE. SOPHOMORE PLUMPS FOR OLD MAN MOSES.</b>
            </h4>
            <p>—Call it, wait, the professor said, opening his long lips wide to reflect. Call it, let me see. Call it: <i xml:lang="la">deus nobis hæc otia fecit.</i></p>
            <p>—No, Stephen said. I call it <i epub:type="se:name.publication.short-story">A Pisgah Sight of Palestine</i> or <i epub:type="se:name.publication.short-story">The Parable of The Plums</i>.</p>
            <p>—I see, the professor said.</p>
            <p>He laughed richly.</p>
            <p>—I see, he said again with new pleasure. Moses and the promised land. We gave him that idea, he added to J. J. O’Molloy.</p>
            <h4 id="pgepubid00072">
            <b>HORATIO IS CYNOSURE THIS FAIR JUNE DAY</b>
            </h4>
            <p>J. J. O’Molloy sent a weary sidelong glance towards the statue and held his peace.</p>
            <p>—I see, the professor said.</p>
            <p>He halted on sir John Gray’s pavement island and peered aloft at Nelson through the meshes of his wry smile.</p>
            <h4 id="pgepubid00073">

            <p>—Onehandled adulterer, he said smiling grimly. That tickles me, I must say.</p>
            <p>—Tickled the old ones too, Myles Crawford said, if the God Almighty’s truth was known.</p>
